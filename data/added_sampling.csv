"Hi, I'm Jake. I'm from England where it's currently 00:06 and I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I guess I need to put my thoughts somewhere (like a diary of sorts.)
I've felt dreadful for about 3 years now, progressively getting worse to the point of hating every fibre of my being. I've never really spoken to anyone about my thoughts or feelings, so maybe I'm not depressed, maybe it's normal to feel like this, but something tells me it isn't.
However, I am not here for sympathy. I'm writing this because I intend to turn my life around in 2018, I want to lose weight, put more work into university, maybe pick up some hobbies and TRY to be more social. So I intend to return to this post in 3 months or 6 months or a year when I've hopefully managed to change my life for the better, and I hope YOU can do the same, whoever you are, wherever you are.

"To me, depression is a gaping pit I always spiral down into, further into darkness. It's not something you can rid yourself of JUST with a positive attitude, but I'd like to believe that it helps.

So I wanted to write something with the emphasis on that ONE thing I got going for me in 2017, and that I hope to bring with me to 2018. I internalize most things, but I do realize how others have a very strong impact on my well-being, and for the first time, I got some warm feelings.

but that doesn't make it any less true

depression is alive in whatever place I lay and hang

hoping for a miracle, but I think that one is you,

stick around to witness, I'm starting something new

caught up with my shadow, the myself that I once knew,

I gotta say, you got me feeling great through and through

it's the new year nothing but now i know what to do,

self-pity was the norm, but now I look foward to

So, you know those people that don't really have depression but pretend they do? Yeah, this is me. It doesn't mean life is easy for me, everything is still very difficult and was like that for the past 5-6 months. It's just not bad enough to be called depression. Everybody else has it much, *much* worse. I just don't really feel good anymore. And I just know that I'm pretending and I don't really deserve anything because of this. I'm just in this gray zone where it's not bad enough to remotely think about getting any help I don't deserve but not good enough for me to be happy. And everything is just getting worse.

"This is quite difficult to talk about with people I know, or therapists for that matter, so I'm hoping this platform of strangers will make things easier...

I've had these thoughts for roughly 5-years now, with the exception of a 4-month stretch, when I felt happy (literally for the first and only time). 

The thought of killing myself is not only terrifying, I know that it's wrong (in every sense of the word). I'd never want to put my family through that, nor myself; however, I can't help but fantasize about the idea of some freak accident occurring to put me out of this misery.  

My struggles with my happiness stem from a very young age, and things simply have not gotten better. The 4-month stretch was beyond surreal. It was when I realized I had never been happy before, and unfortunately not since. 

The idea of some freak accident ending my life is so appealing; it would end my depressing thoughts and feelings, would take the guilt off of my hands (instead of doing it myself), and while it would still be crushing to my family, it wouldn't have the added drama of ""what could we have done to help?"" The idea of living life for another ~50-years with the absence of happiness truly sounds awful, not worth it in the slightest.

"Why do you think you don't deserve to be happy?

Is it because you think you are a bad person or that you made a bad decision?  Is it because you think you have nothing to offer to the world?  What if I told you that you don't have to be a bad person.  Forgive yourself for making a bad decision and promise yourself you won't do it again, what good is it to continue to beat yourself up about it?  It is not making you a better person, you are not becoming happier.  You may think you have nothing to offer; but I bet when you convince yourself you do, you will have something to offer.  If you think you don't deserve to be happy, you are wrong.

Being happy isn't just going to come to you.  You aren't going to wake up feeling like you are on top of the world.  You have to make it happen.  You have to decide to get up and be the best you can.  It takes practice to be happy, you have to work at it.  

Depression, atleast from my point of view, has been highly self inflicted.   I chose to stop eating, I chose to stop trying, I chose to stop caring, I chose to stop talking to those around me, and I chose to stop doing the things I once loved to do.  

I and you need to choose to to be happy.  You need to choose to get healthy.  You need to choose to get out of bed. You need to choose to start caring.  You need to choose to love those around you.

Someone loves you, if you don't think that then I believe someone will love you if you put yourself in the position for them to love you.

My emotions have been getting out of hands lately and I'm so tired.,0,
"Hey, first post on here!
I feel weird. I don't feel bad, just weird. I've been feeling like this for quite a while. Like two years or something.
Let me give you some background. I'm a 16 y/o dude living in Norway. I have it well. Life is good to me. 
I get good grades at school (B/A), I have (some) friends, I have a nice family (my parents got divorced ~3 years ago, but that's fine).
Everything is just fine.

But somehow I feel like my whole life is ""meh"". I don't see any point in doing anything. 
I have hobbies; I like video games, I play the piano, I make videos, I do some photography. I have interest in politics. 
I go to a school where I do things I like; photography, video game design (yes, Norway is weird and privileged), video editing etc.

I just lose motivation so quickly. ""Oh, I'll play this game."" Ten minutes go by. ""Uh, this is boring/unrewarding/I could be doing something better/etc."" 
Or; ""Oooh, I'll make this video game."" I work on it for 2 days. ""I could just go back to not doing anything, and not have to do this.""
I've been trying different things. I don't know why this happens, really. Do I think long-term before I think short-term?

One good (recent) example of this is New Year's Eve; everyone is emotional and screaming ""Happy New Year"" like it's some sort of rebirth. No. 
The number in the calendar is different, and there's gonna be another Christmas in 12 months. That's all there is to it in my opinion.

I don't know, is there some secret to life? Am I just gonna one day wake up, feel completely different, and have endless energy to do everything?

(P.S. I don't know if this qualifies as ""depression"". If this shouldn't be posted here, could somebody direct me to somewhere this can be posted?)",0,

I'm actually kind of curious what it's like (although I know that once it will be time to go I will shit myself).

Should I tell her I wanna die ? Or will that lend me in a ward ? 

Should I take pills even tho I keep reading how people regret ever getting them and want to get off them and the withdrawals are the worst thing they have ever had to go through ? It kind of discourages me..

"Since ""obviously"" we depressed people are just ""helpless souls"" who need to be ""saved"" by the ""normal people"".

They say ""just be happy"", GOLLY GEE you think I haven't fucking thought of that yet?

Sometimes depressed people don't want help. Of course, help is absolutely necessary sometimes, but quite frankly it's none of your business to come into our spaces and tell us how we have to act or what we have to say. If you have depression sometimes you need a place to just rant. 

It's nobody's obligation here to ""solve depression"". The point isn't to ""save"" depressed people. This is not the place for non-depressed people to try to ""save us"" and feel good about themselves in the process. This is a place where people who are trapped in suffering get to scream into their pillows and maybe have someone there who hears them and understands them and maybe even responds to them.

"Im shocked. I didnt realize how much I had lost. Im not thin by any means, but... Im not really that fat anymore. I think im one of the healthiest people in my family (though most of them are obese or suffer eating disorders). Ive gotten so used to my diet, but now I need to maintain what I have. Losing much more would affect me negatively... But it makes me sad that I still dont like my appearence.

I expected I would just suddenly find myself attractive if I hit the right weight, but I still dont. I dont know how to feel about it... I know I should be happy that Ive fulfilled something ive been working on for 3 years, but I still dont feel good enough. Hard to believe people when they say you look good when you cant even get a girlfriend, you know? Guess that counts as a rant. I dunno.",0,
"I recently remembered this very vivid moment from my childhood: I was probably 9 years old, and I distinctly remember feeling hopeless and wanting to kill my self. I was crying and screaming that nobody loved me and I wanted to die. A decade later and I'm laying in bed with cuts on my arm and thinking about every mistake I've ever made- wondering why I am the way that I am and praying to whatever may lie beyond the endless void that I don't wake up in the morning.

"I'm sorry.

My entire life, until recently, I thought depression was merely another word for being sad.  I had thought it was just a feeling that would quickly go away.  I had thought that depression was something that was not a big deal, that it was more of a joke than anything. Whether it be society telling me that it wasn't serious or if it was just me being nieve; I need you to know I'm sorry I held these beliefs. 

Until you experienced it, you can never really understand just how terrible and debilitating it is.  I read some of your stories and a peice of me breaks.  I can't even start to begin to comprehend how some of you must feel.  I don't want to downplay my own experience (because I now know depression, no matter the severity, is serious) but it seems so miniscule compared to some of your struggles.

I can't believe there was once a time where I would even ask my self, ""Why can't these people just be happy."". If only it was that easy.  I really wish it was.  From the bottom of my heart, I wish you the best in 2017.  Merry Christmas, happy holidays and make this year great.

I'm sorry.",0,
"You see, I work as a horticulturist, we deal with shrubs, weeds and other shorter plants. My job is so-so, but I hate the idea of working.

So how do I stay sane? Well, there are plenty of red ants from time to time, and those little rays of sunshine loves to attacking anything in their vicinity, even if that thing is there to tend to their home.

I've been bitten several times now, and it hurts quite a bit. So, these days I love repaying the favor, it'd be selfish if all I do is take without giving right?

I'll stomp on them, crush them with my gloved hands, and my personal favorite, after they manage to climb onto me and bite me... Is to smack them lightly, enough to cripple and disorient, then I pull them apart, limb from limb... All the while asking it, ""how does it feel to be the one getting hurt?""

Sometimes I leave them with two legs, because it's amusing.",0,

I have something like a sad mood that come out of nowhere, which I feel most of time, always when I'm alone. I feel like this for few hours, always in the begining of a day and in the end.

"The thought only came to me after a dream i had last night.  I was John Constantine (a DC comics magician who has a history of screwing over demons) and I got caught by a demon.  I was put into a torture chamber for two years (knives cutting me, demons hitting slicing me, riding a bike to exhaustion and beyond, etc) and even though it hurt like hell, I knew I would get out, I knew that the story would go on and I would be able to get back on my feet.  Yet yesterday and today, in my waking life, I felt/feel significantly depressed with no such hope.

How is my dreaming brain ""me"" and also not ""me""?  How can I feel so frickin awful while I am awake but somehow, that part of my brain isn't accessed while I am dreaming?  Something tells me most psychiatrists and neurologists still don't know the answer, but I felt compelled to ask.",0,

Hi for most of a day I feel bad but now i feel just...kinda empty. I think I was happy for some time but then I realized that I feel kinda...feared about something?

"I'm stuck. At 18 years old I realize this empty feeling is all I know. I have no recollection of a childhood. No memory of a day before I just feel numb all of the time. To me a world outside of this mental state doesn't exist. It is misery; its also my comfort. I try to escape the grasp of my vices, everything and everyone that's made me this way. Every step I make on the up is just ten to plummet. There's no leaving my own sick head. That's why is easier to remain numb than to feel anything at all.

"My therapist tried to introduce a breathing method to reduce anxiety, which I am sure works. For real normal people. He was saying things like ""If you breathe when you are stressed you'll be able to feel happier and less afraid"" ""But I don't really think I feel any emotions other than fear..."" ""Well my job isn't to make you happy, it's to help you deal with your anxiety"". ""But I don't feel those emotions...that won't help me..."" Useless. They don't understand or care. 

Ignoring all of this, for the sake of argument lets ignore the fact that human life doesn't matter. Who are they to say we don't have the right to death? Why do they get to decide that? Why do they get to say that?

If I were to go and see a GP and they prescribed something, how much would they usually prescribe? Is it a large amount of medication? Does it state whether they are anti-depressants usually?

Also if i were prescribed medication would I be asked to attend a follow up appointment at some point? If so how often?",0,

I was forcibly admitted to the hospital twice for attempted suicide (pills, and cutting respectively) and eventually got hooked up with a sliding scale office that had therapists in the West Seattle area that got me on a biweekly visit and eventually prescribed antidepressants. 

Over the past three years, I have moved multiple times, to different states, and recently moved back to Washington State. I had a counselor in West Seattle that got me the recommendation for antidepressants and they seemed to work for me; but after moving around (and losing most everything I owned in the process) I am thinking I need to get back to both therapy and medication; however, I don‚Äôt remember her name or phone number. West Seattle is a long distance from where I currently live in Federal Way, but I don‚Äôt know anywhere else to turn to.

Does anybody have an idea of how to find a sliding scale clinic in the area? When I google sliding scale clinics, I don‚Äôt get many, if ANY, therapists, just dentists and pediatric doctors.

I was like ok, well I was than reminded that I don't have many friends and my family is distant. I was just so involved with work and I don't really have anyone. Well I was talking to the surgeon and she said it best about all that was happening ""I am sorry, just bad luck"" And I kept thinking about that all week and its so true. Bad luck.

"I have been depressed for the past 3 years. In the last year my mind descended into the darkest depths. I had thoughts I never could have imagined myself having. However, after a few marijuana-induced ego killing trips, I realized that I was the cause of my own depression. I always thought that this was the hand that the universe dealt me and I would have to continue living a life with no joy. However, this was the way I looked at life because THIS WAS THE WAY I WANTED TO LOOK AT LIFE. I realized that my perception actually created my reality and that all the help that people were offering me was actually genuine. My ego just didn't want to accept the fact that people actually cared about me and therefore I continued to spiral down deeper into depression.

Now, its a New Year and I know what I have to do to better my life, however I need help figuring out how to do it. I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with depression and could give me tips on what they did to slowly rehabilitate themselves to their former mental space before depression. I know I will never be 100% and perfect but right now it's like my mind is a fog and it's slowly clearing but I haven't seen sunshine in so long and part of me still wants to stay in the fog because it's comfortable and I am used to it.",0,
"I've personally thought about it -- several times a week when times were bad, and each time it was ruled out as a non-viable solution. I do, however, consider it an option on the table if circumstances call for it. 

The issue I want to address is the stigma on suicide.

I know people that have been clinically depressed for decades, and I've watched them take no joy out of life. Why prolong it if you've been dealt a shitty hand? Is society being selfish in wanting to see that people can change for the better just to affirm its own views of the world? The mere mention of suicide brings throngs of people trying to ""help"", and often instilling false hope. Will we ever ever say, ""yeah, it's a shitty situation. Offing yourself is probably the best option.""

There is no cure for clinical depression, and I bet those who eventually do kill themselves were dragged through the mud before they did it, effectively prolonging their suffering.

"My depression is catching up to me... again... right when I think I'm doing alright, the drowning begins again. I'm tired of running around in circles to get away from my demons only to end up consumed by them anyway.... 

My life has been constant ups and downs, from abusive parents and partners, to self sabotage and circumstances out of my control that almost ruined my life... 

When am I going to stop being punished....? I'm a good person.. I try to be... why do I keep getting handed sour lemons when I try so hard to be happy and make good lemonade? ",1,"abusive parents,partners,self sabotage"
"I'm not a strong person. At all. I've had an ok life, but I was coddled and overprotected for the majority of it. Now I'm 22 and every time something happens to me, I tell myself that I would honestly rather die than fixing it. 

I'm pretty obese, and my roommate tells me that I need to lose weight. I honestly would much rather put a shotgun under my chin and end everything. I don't want to work for anything, I don't really want to put effort into my life, especially when I already hate it so fucking much. I drink about 2-4 energy drinks a say too, so I'm pretty much just waiting for a heart attack to happen. 

I don't know why I'm posting in here. If you think that wanting to kill myself over these things is stupid, then you can honestly fuck right off. I'm sick of being told that, and the only thing that does is make me want to end it all even more.",1,"pretty obese, roommate tells me that I need to lose weight"
It all started in fifth grade.. It was there I realized what was loneliness and being an outcast. I feel like an outcast honestly everywhere and I feel like garbage of who I am. From 5th grade to (currently)10th grade I have been becoming more and more depressed. At first it just started as sadness from time to time but around 9th grade it really kicked into overdrive. Its gotten to the point where I don't truly laugh anymore or anything not even my own family make me genuinely happy. To make matters worse I probably don't have it as bad as some people here but idk why I can't get that through my head...anyways have a happy new years everyone.. Heres to another year of depression lol. ,1," loneliness, being an outcast"
"I just got to thinking about how much time I spend alone. Throughout elementary and middle school I had some friends that I hung out with. I lost them all when I went to high school, where I was forced to make new friends. None of those friendships stuck though, and I never hung out with any of the people I talked to. Imagine that: four years of going to school and coming home and spending all that time by yourself. I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person‚Äôs psyche‚Ä¶ I like to think I introspect a lot and I‚Äôm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i‚Äôve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. I‚Äôm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm sucking all the energy from everyone there. It‚Äôs like that in college too. I just started last semester and I‚Äôve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like this‚Ä¶",1,They either pity me or ignore me like the plague
My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù never talk to me unless I‚Äôm the only one available and I‚Äôm so sick of it but I don‚Äôt want to burn those bridges cause I know it‚Äôll hurt more to get rid of them altogether than to just suck up the pain of being left out ,1,"friendsù never talk to me, unless I am the only one available"

Anyways I offered to my new friend group that I would host a New Years party at my house and they like were really into it but oddly controlling. I invited 2 of my older friends but unknown to me my new friend group had problems with them. One of my old friends was a old boyfriend of one of my new friends girlfriend and apparently caused a lot of ‚Äúharassment‚Äù mean while this all happened 2 years ago.... I know the girlfriend isn‚Äôt mentally stable she‚Äôs off she almost killed my old friend twice but like I thought I‚Äôd be okay to invite my old friend but I just got shit on by basically all my ‚Äúnew friends ‚Äú I was basically forced to uninvited my old friends but instead I cancelled the party and am now having a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù party with my older friends.

"Hey. If you‚Äôre reading this then...well that means I went through with what I was thinking. Then again, it was a stupid idea so if you are reading this I‚Äôve gone insane. Now, you will not know my name because it doesn‚Äôt need to be revealed for this. Maybe someday I‚Äôll be strong enough to face it, I mean people will find out eventually. You‚Äôre probably really confused...so I‚Äôll just get straight to the point. I‚Äôm here to tell you my story. Usually I don‚Äôt talk about my life...actually I really don‚Äôt talk about it at all. There are certain things I‚Äôm not going to share of course, things I vowed to myself I would keep secret until death. Honestly I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm doing this. I just really need to get some stuff of my chest. Life. Sucks. At least it does for me. It didn‚Äôt always..I used to be this innocent bright and cheery kid..but I guess the more I grew the more I realized how messed up society and basically the entire world is. You see, the first time I ever felt different was in 5th grade. People would make fun of me, call me stupid, tease me, call my old life weird and dumb. There were other things but I can't remember...I‚Äôve spent 3 years learning to forget. The day it became too much for me to hold in is when everything changed. I was sitting down taking it all in when I just broke. My shield that was keeping them from hurting me...shattered into a million pieces along with my heart, my mind, my soul, my life. I ran to the bathroom and cried for what seemed like forever. I went back to class acting as if I was fine and that nothing happened. Everyday it just got worse. Then summer came, and I was able to start feeling normal. No more people to worry about, I didn't dread leaving my house. 6th grade came around, and I met the most amazing people that I will remember for the rest of my life. 6th grade was a good year, my grades were good, I had great friends...but there was still something that was off. Around the end of the year I started getting these awful thoughts. Regret filled my life. There were so many things that I wished I could redo and I still do. Everyday of my life I think about it and think of how stupid I was. Iwas so careless and didn‚Äôt realize that what I had done could ruin my life. Now what I did exactly won‚Äôt be shared...if anyone ever found out I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. I can barely do that now and I‚Äôm the only one who knows. Summer came around again, and the thoughts got worse. They aren't just bad thoughts about being sad and depressed...I started getting suicidal thoughts...hundreds of them everyday. I dreaded going back to school. I had people in my class that bullied me in 5th grade. I didn‚Äôt want to go through that again. So...one night I had an idea. I was at a very low point and was contemplating suicide. I ended up chickening out...but some days I wonder if it would have actually worked. Part of me wishes I went through with it, the other half is glad I didn‚Äôt. School came around, I was performing well, and the kids didn‚Äôt even say anything at all. My friends and I became even more close.My teachers were amazing. 7th grade, I have to say was the happiest point of my life I had ever been in for an extreme amount of time. When it came to an end however so did that happiness. Suicide crossed my mind even more, I started self harming in ways that no one would notice. I would do the stereotypical thing and just blame the cat. 8th grade came. My grades dropped. I couldn‚Äôt find the energy to do anything. I was constantly tired and I still am. My dreams faded, my hopes for a better life went away because I know that would never happen. I got this app, kik. I should've known to delete the minute I got it. Part of my past revolves around this dumb app. Actually it‚Äôs what started EVERYTHING. And it‚Äôs all. my. fault. I hate myself for it. I worry about so many people I‚Äôve met on the app. I love them all, they're great people and I‚Äôve stopped caring for myself ever since then. I just wish everything would go away. There is honestly so much more to this story, but if I were to tell it all it would take me a million years. Now...we‚Äôve hit the present. I‚Äôve stopped eating three meals a day. Some Days I barely get it one. But that‚Äôs ok...I like the feeling of hunger. I like the pain of the blade when it passesover my arm. I like being alone, the less people who know me, the less I can hurt them. The more fake smiles I put on, the more people leave me alone, and believe I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôm suicidal but no one knows. I can‚Äôt tell anyone...I won‚Äôt tell anyone.At least personally. This, what I‚Äôm doing anonymously is fine. I can tell my story without feeling too judged. Even if I was...it would be nothing compared to how I judge and hate myself. And now you‚Äôve made it to the end...sorry it was so long. There‚Äôs so much more to it than that...that's just the basic stuff behind my real emotions...the emotions that are fading. The emotions that I will soon lose, in fact I‚Äôm pretty sure I already have.

"I'm here to share my feelings. What does it mean when you get a sudden pang of sadness that refuses to leave n leaves you wanting to cry for now reason?  I've googled it and it's given me three reasons 
1. Hormonal imbalance. 
2. Anemia.
3. Depression. 

Let me tell you a bit about myself. 
I'm Li, female, 20 years old. I've had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I was in a bad relationship for almost a year before I found the person I actually wanted to be with. But the situation in which I got into a relationship with him was rough you could say.  You see he was my best friend and I didn't want to loose him. He'd liked me for almost 2 years at that time and I knew I'd loose him forever if I kept him waiting.  But know I'm very happy I did because it's the best thing that ever happened to me.

The person before him, was the worst choice of my life, but not the first worst choice.  I've made two wrong choices in life that I regret. 

1. My ex. Initially all was fine and I liked the time we shared together. My feelings started to get strong until I was stuck in a place where I thought I couldn't be able to live without him. But sadly his feelings were the total opposite. As time went by he started losing interest. He did cheat on me, three times. I was stupid to keep on giving chances to him. He knew I was all his and maybe that's why he started taking me for granted. And that's when things got bad. I know I'm not a good person and I've done some things too but I'm sure I was all loyal.
He started getting abusive. 

Valentine's Day '14. I was 16. We lived 6 bus stops away and it took time to get to him. Traffic made it take even longer . When I got there he was pissed because I took so much time. He grabbed me by the arm and started calling me names i'd gotten used to at that point. We walked until we reached darker and empty streets. We didn't talk to each other. We held hands. His grip was tight, squeezing my fingers together. We reached a house that looked like it was empty. All the lights were out. It wasn't his house, just a random house. We went in through the gate and to the side of the house so that it hid us from the main road and from any neighbouring house. Basically we were hidden from the world.  He started kissing me hard. His hands were on my shoulders. I was pinned to the wall. I tried to move but he was heavier than me, even though he was as skinny as a stick. I was uncomfortable. I didn't kiss him back. He got pissed, called me a slut, said I was cheating on him. The usual. Then it came. The first slap. It was hard and sudden and unexpected. I didn't know what was happening. I was crying at that point. My mouth was shut with his hand. His other hand moved down. Kissing me on my neck Now, biting and sucking . I'd had enough I wanted to go home. I told him to stop. I'd had enough, I kept telling him to stop. He didn't. But I didn't stop.  He got irritated I guess or IDK. Came more slaps. And a final push to the wall. And he walked away.. 
I didn't know my way back home, my way to the bus stop that would take me home. I was alone. My heart was crying. I found my way back, went home. Texted him again and again apologizing. I thought he hated me I thought he'd break up. I couldn't bear that idea. I was in a bad place.

"A little background about myself:I have always been struggling with depression, anxiety and self-worth issue. It was not always like this, I remember a time, about 15 years back when I was a confident and energetic child. But over the past 15 years I have been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence i have in myself and have zero-self worth. Often being an entertainment for others, I just feel like my life is destined to be an entertainment for others, always there to bring happiness and joy to others at the expense of getting hurt myself.

First forward I am 20 years old now and have attempted sucide about 3 times, each time I was stopped. A few months back, I met this girl who was really amazing and we started talking and got quite close as friends. A few months ago I asked her for the opportunity to woo her and she say she will consider after I have touched her, nonetheless we continue chatting and we got so close to the point that we actually planned an overseas trip together for Christmas.

Fast forward to the trip, it was amazing and I (we) had a blast, however, on the last day, things started to take a turn for the worst. Her reply started getting very cold and she blocked me from her social. As we were staying in separate hotels I attempted to commit sucide again, only to be stopped by my friend who called the hotel and got the general manager to came up and stop me. 

Fast forward a few days from that, her reply to my messages has been nothing but cold, distant and it takes her hours to reply and that is if she ever reply at all. I really wondered what I did wrong. I tried asking her but she told me it was nothing and that she was just busy. But unfortunately, this has totally destroyed what ever little self-confidence and drive I have left and I just feel that I have suddenly plunged into darkness.

After 4 failed attempts I realise I'm too much of a wimp to do anything directly resulting in ending my life. I just want to stop existing as well. Today is New Year eve and I really just feel like wanting to just OD on pills and just hope I would never wake up tomorrow. Since for the most part of my life, everyone has been treating me as entertainment, I feel by doing this, I can present a finale to everybody, show everyone behind the fake smile that I has put on for so long....my friend scolded me for being so pathetic to put my happiness and life in the control of a girl but  for the past few months, my focus was only on her and I really enjoyed her company. I really don‚Äôt know what happened and I really don‚Äôt wanna lost this friendship, it is really ok if we don‚Äôt get together but I do not want to lose this friendship as well.

I am really lost, really sad and really distant...I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore other than just not exist since I feel like a disappointment to everybody (average student, not much achievements, generally a disappointment) I use feel like lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow.",1,"been hurt and bullied to the point where i have lose any confidence,have zero-self worth,she blocked me from her social,After 4 failed attempts,just not exist, lying down tonight and never waking up tomorrow "

"I never had much friends throughout my life. Never really hang out or play tag when I was a kid. I was a obscure kid with your self-esteem. Occasionally got bullied, cried a little, didn‚Äôt tell anyone and lived on with it. I have make some pretty good friends after I grew up, they were friends I could talk with. We‚Äôre now working adults now and well, we drifted apart.
I‚Äôm at my work, have no problem with social interaction and self-esteem anymore. I feel like my life have been a performance. I fake a smile to my colleagues, to my parents but I know that I‚Äôm still that kid, wanting something more from life. I questioned myself have I ever been happy and no I have not. I feel like a failure in everything I do. Every step I take forward just spiral me deeper. I thought I could outgrow depression, but living into my late 20s, I don‚Äôt think thats possible. Maybe I just hate myself, maybe I hate society for making me this way.

"I am finally numb to it. And it feels good. It feels good to feel nothing instead of crying and just wishing to be dead, the mental agony I‚Äôve experienced throughout my life is so very painful in a way I can‚Äôt describe. Me sitting down calmly and wanting to die is a lot better than me crying and hurting myself because the ‚Äúpain‚Äù is so terrible. 

I can‚Äôt escape him. I can‚Äôt escape my father. His voice is in my head every time I don‚Äôt do anything perfectly. When I look in the mirror. What he said about me mirrors how I think about myself still. 
I always end up dating men just like him. They make me feel crazy and emotionally and mentally abuse me to no end. The guy I thought I loved just told me yesterday that I should be happy that it took him ‚Äúthis long‚Äù to start pretending to throw heavy objects at me angrily.

The numbness is much better than the depression. Maybe I‚Äôll get numb to the point where it‚Äôll be easy to kill myself instead of always chickening out. There‚Äôs nothing for me here. I am selfish and want just one thing: Love, and I can‚Äôt get it. And I‚Äôm not going to stay around waiting in pain and mental anguish until I die, just so other people can benefit off of my love and care. I want something for me for once.

I feel so alone and I think about dying almost every day. I wish I didn‚Äôt. I feel like the sooner I end my life the better. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it just yet. A tiny bit of me thinks that maybe I should wait, maybe I will get Lucky. But will the suffering be worth it. 

Maybe someone will find me with my wrists slit. Maybe someone will find me hung up in my closet. Maybe then people will understand. Because right now no one does. No one ever has. No matter how many attempts I‚Äôve made to get people to notice I‚Äôm hurting. I fantasize about my death sometimes. I know that‚Äôs not normal. Hence one more reason why I should not be alive.

"I am 16M and a black male in a racist area in South Dakota. Whenever I'd make a friend as a little kid, their parents would shoo me away and tell their own kid I'm a criminal because I looked mean and dirty and my parents were. Even the Hispanic kids who get the same rap around here weren't allowed to talk to me. I wore the same clothes every day and rarely showered. It's the same problem as we have now. Technically we have running water and a shower, but it's so filthy and full of grime and backed up poo water that it's less disgusting to go without. I've been bullied and completely friendless since I was 11.

My parents have too high an income to qualify for social programs and spend all their money on drugs and eating out. They live like pigs and leave all their empties and hoarded things everywhere.

I know there are a lot of black people/poor people who have been successful and lived happy lives, but I am much different than them in that I am so easily broken. I am a shell of a person, and I developed epilepsy and another disability that limits my fine motor skills. I have seizures where I can't stop moving a limb repeatedly, lose consciousness for upwards of a minute, or both. It gets worse when I miss doses of medication. I have randomly vomited at times before being diagnosed and treated.

I stopped going to school when I was 14 because I had a seizure at school and pooped my pants. I am ""home schooled"". It doesn't matter if i have a diploma though when nobody wants to hire someone who could have seizures on work time. I'm going to just be on disability until I end it. Nobody cares about me and people who know me will be glad to have me gone.

I don't care if ""it gets better,"" and I won't call a suicide hotline. Please don't respond with clich√©s like that. I want you to tell me how to actually fix my life if you know how. If that doesn't work, I'll probably just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life.",1,"black people,poor people, so easily broken,  criminal because I looked mean and dirty, been bullied and completely friendless, drugs ,  just end it because there is no point prolonging a useless life"
"This is on wikipedia, the page title is ""Social psychology"".

&gt;  The self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.[18]:109 Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by believing in a just world, blaming victims for their suffering, and making defensive attributions, which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.[18]:111 Researchers have found that mildly depressed individuals often lack this bias and actually have more realistic perceptions of reality (as measured by the opinions of others).[20]

Lol, sorry, i should have explained what this shit means.

Realistic perception means you can understand both personal deffects and also situation ones, it just means you don't excuse yourself for your mistakes or wrong doings, but you also will not excuse anyone. You have higher moral standards. You see things for what they are. 

Happy people will fuck up today, rationalize their bullshit away in one sentence and completely forget about it. They say it's strenght but in reality is just ignoring.

"After having gained some optimism back and starting to be a bit more positive, here it comes again an ocean of sadness that waves over me. Thoughts circulating around my brain at what seems to be at light-speed.

It's crazy how you can think and feel this is by far the lowest point of my life, it can't get any lower, and then a lower point comes along sooner or later that makes you reflect ""wow how can this be lower then that time? ""How much lower can the human mind and heart tolerate before it caves in?"" 

I'm on my 4th. Honestly i'm actually impressed i'm still here somehow.

Of all my 30 years of living this is has been the most educational and informative year of life ever, the year that taught me all the truths of life and humanity.

Are humans completely selfish by design? Or is this a product of centuries of brainwash by society? Humans by nature are selfish and competitive but it's more of a survivor defense mechanism than anything, I think all the rest of the cruel values and selfishness that has been brainwashed into humanities minds and hearts is definitely a product of the masses. I especially know this since I use to be one of them, utterly brainwashed, hurting others never realizing it or the extent. But thankfully I always in the depths of my heart had that urge, that desire to be a better human being programmed into my heart even in the bigoted ways of my past.

Everybody lies, EVERYONE LIES. When I say that I don't mean 100% I mean 80% the majority who far outweigh the few people you can run into who are apart of that other 20%, meaning it's almost invisible. Even that neighbor with his kids, loving wife, who wakes at 5am everyday to drink his coffee and goes to work, who smiles at you when he sees you in the morning and asks ""how you are?"" and bids a ""good day"" to you is some selfish prick who believes, who teaches and preaches these terrible values to his family thinking it's normal, it's alright, ""we're the good ones"", ""we should be proud for being such upstanding citizens"" even that guy is a total selfish evil prick that goes blind to most of societies eyes.

I don't know how to live with myself anymore, I've tried for months to figure out a way to want to continue to live in what I know and feel.

How can I integrate back into society knowing how they treats others? The racial inequality, how they view homosexuality, bisexuality, how they treat and think about people who are transgender, classicism, sexism, nationalism, religious discrimination, linguistic discrimination, neurological descrimination. How most women treat most men now, they're all evil. How transgender people treat cisgender people because ""they could never understand"" whelp they treated us this way so now ""stfu"" your cis you have no say you ""evil cis!"" It's nothing but hate one way or the other, even the person fighting for what's right is doing it by doing something so wrong, even if the person is good in your eyes there's something dark and fucked up about them.

I'm no saint but everyday I self-reflect, everyday I look at how I can improve as a human, I can do wrong and I can hurt, but I have the self-awareness to listen to my fellow human and learn from it and be better, to see my faults, where I can improve, because I can't stand the thought of a stranger hurting because I had something to do with it directly or indirectly.

Let's pollute, let's kill our planet, let's have plastic surgery for non-medical reasons, let's hurt animals, let's make MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY, let's bully in real life and on the internet, let's have privilege, let's eye for an eye, because if we suffered in the past I guess than those who oppressed should suffer now, even the innocent ones, so you're fucked if you're a man, or you're white, or you're Christian, or Jewish, or cisgender, or bisexual, or or or or or or. Let's not be educated, let's think we learned so much and enough, we shouldn't have to be taught better anymore, because ""we know better"".

Why is there so much risk to living a new day everyday even if you're mildly successful?

If I'm bisexual, my sexuality will probably get dismissed left and right all day.

If i'm gay I better not be somewhere like Lithuania.

If i'm transgender, well i'll have to look over my shoulder and fear for my life 68% of the time while never being taken seriously as my gender.

If i'm cisgender, well you better get use to the fact you're ""evil"" because I guess I had a conventional upbringing.

If i'm religious, well that's all hocus pocus now, you're beliefs are secondary to mines!

If you're unattractive, best get use to the idea you'll never get taken completely seriously, you'll have to work and prove yourself 20 times more to other people and probably still not get as good as a opportunity.

If you're a woman, hope you love that unequal salary and being slut-shammed for wearing a skirt or shorts one size too small and tight.

If you're shorter than 5'7, good luck in the dating world, HA good luck getting that job because statistically taller people are hired more and valued more.

If you have tattoos, get ready for those stereotypes and awkward looks of judgement.

If you're ""fat"", GUESS WHAT YOU'RE LAZY.

If you're too skinny, remember women love fits guys and men love voluptuous ladies!

If you're not making at least 100K, might as well die, you're like that crap that went on clearance at a dollar store nobody wants and will go salvage.

If you're bi-polar, have ptsd, depressed, on the spectrum and many of the other frequent and normal neurological conditions everyone suffers normally daily in society, all those immensely gorgeous models, those intellectually genius people, all those successful and wealthy people who have those conditions, no one bats an eye to them, because if you have an issue and your worth doesn't translate to instant money, well you're just a fucked up person, a waste. 

Doesn't matter if you came from a violent background, homelessness, starvation, pain, a violent family, a history of prejudice. The older you are the more you better have your shit together! Because money, looks, degrees, that shit is just handed to you like bubblegum from a candy dispenser apparently.

Fuck you for telling me it'll get better, you mean if I somehow manage another week, or year, or 2 or 3 without fucking completely losing it mentally and going insane or offing myself because that's how psychological distress works, it gets the best of you.

It'll get better alright, when a gosh damn existential miracle happens that magically makes most people not shit even when they're ""good people"" who ""mean well"", when i'm not oppressed every damn waking second because I had no freaking say in my birth!

EAT IT BITCH SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. Thank you humanity you have passed a beautiful legacy to our society. The hippies of back then had it all right, peace and love all ya'll. But those hippies were just a bunch of potheaded wastebags and their little mantra didn't translate to selfishness and money.

"I know tonight is supposed to be a good one but I'm having a hard time shaking the thoughts of just pulling the plug. The thought of going through yet another year in poverty, loneliness, hatred and sadness is almost too much for me to bear.

I'm 23 years old, I've never had a girlfriend, I've barely had any sex to speak of, I work minimum wage shitty jobs, I have no friends, no family to speak of, and no young woman even close to my age seems to want anything to do with me. I get degraded by other men for not having had enough sex, not seeming masculine enough, and while I understand men are supposed to be strong, few people understand that men have feelings too.

It's like my life is some nightmare I can't wake up from. I look young for my age, and while I've been through so much and so many difficult experiences, people only see an 18 year old kid when they look at me. Girls assume I am naive and immature and look the other way, guys assume I'm a pussy. I get nothing, because apparently I am nothing, at least to the naked eye.

"I'm laying in bed and thinking about what a fucked up year I've had. Seriously, what a fucking shit show. Years of depression and other mental illnesses finally caught up to me. Like it beat the shit out of me. I put an end to something fucked up that I did but the damage is still there and not completely cleared because I don't know how to approach the situation because I'm fucking mentally fucked up and I don't even know how to explain that to someone. I spent days in bed, crying, paranoid walking around outside thinking people know all my secrets and all thats wrong with me. I've spent days being yelled at by my parent, being a second parent to my little sibling and still being told that I do nothing. That I don't give. Being emotionally and verbally abused by my sister. Letting guilt numb me till I can't feel anymore. Hating myself on top of hating myself, to the point where I want to rip myself apart whenever I see my reflection. 21 years and I have no fucking friends. I feel like the biggest piece of shit. I don't know who I am, all I know is that I'm depressed and have issues of identity, gender, personality, and traumatic experiences that fucking haunt me. Every time I told myself to go seek help I failed. Every time I tried to have a good day I came back to my room and cried till nothing came out anymore. It was a fucking shitty year. I don't see anything changing in the new year. Don't even know if I'll make it through. Tough shit. I pray every day that I die because I don't have the courage to do it myself.

"Hi there, I'm here really just looking for some help, not for me specifically, but for a friend, or maybe help for me on how to help her. Warning, this is going to be kinda long.

Freshman year of college, I met an amazing girl in my major. Smart, outgoing, an athlete, and she subscribed to my quirky/dark humor. We actually hooked up pretty much right after meeting, I thought I was in love. We fooled around for most of freshman year, I thought things were going great.

Turns out things were not going great. I always felt something was kind of off with her, she would always get this vacant look in her eyes whenever we were fooling around, she was like a different person. As it turns out, she was assaulted in high school, and it really messed with her. She basically lost the ability to say ""no"" but at the same time hated herself for it, she she shut herself away while things happened and then dealt with the personal fallout later. She finally just kinda swore off sex at the beginning of sophomore year. That was her band-aid. I fear she's still fighting a losing battle though.

She isn't sleeping well, she's hiding away from people more and more every day. She gets mad at me for trying to get too close. She's scared to let herself have any fun, to go out and party because she's afraid that she'll fall back into old habits, and she can't afford to do that anymore. She has pretty vivid nightmares regularly. I've witnessed one, they're fucking awful. I didn't want to touch her and influence her dream, but I had to keep her from thrashing into desks. Lose-Lose situation.

She says she's smart enough that she knows suicide isn't the answer for her, but I know she has lapses in judgement, I know she has made attempts in the past, or at least plans for attempts. I'm just afraid everything is just going to get worse, that shes going to keep having these lapses and shes going to get closer and closer.

I just want some help, some advice. I want to know how to make sure I don't lose one of the few people in this world I truly care about. I wonder if any of you have been in similar situations, either mine or her's, and what kinds of steps you have taken.

I was supposed to go all out senior year. I wanted to have the greatest ‚Äúlast‚Äù summer break, I wanted to carve pumpkins for Halloween and go to a haunted house. I wanted to have a FriendsGiving and I wanted to make a gingerbread house. I wanted to go to a crazy New Years party and count down to 2018.

Between the last part and this one, my therapist and I established a history of medications and treatment, and whatnot. When we got back into the real issues, it went as follows;

&gt; Hello /////-

&gt; Thanks for sharing information related to your medical and mental health history. It is evident that you are being intentional about being open about your history , symptoms and experiences. Please remember that being open and willing to work through things that are blocking your current progress and ""fueling"" ongoing mood symptoms and making interpersonal functioning difficult is KEY to reducing your symptoms and rebuilding your life. It is important to get this information so that together we can get a clearer understanding of your past and current history. This will be very useful when we meet on Thursday as we review the therapeutic process and begin to start setting goals.

&gt; /////- I am sorry to hear that you experienced years of sexual abuse . You are definitely a survivor and a man of courage. In our society the trauma that men experience is sometimes swept under the rug, without any acknowledgement. You won't find that here. ALL of who you are and what you have experienced is welcome in this space and vital to your healing . Self knowledge and awareness is the basis of all knowledge . I am glad you took a chance by sharing something so personal. I can't imagine trying to deal with all of the thoughts, emotions and isolation this has brought into your life .

&gt; You know, I can't help but wonder how this trauma impacted your view of yourself, others , the world and your place in it. Have you ever talked about this part of your life experiences with anyone else ? Does your family or partner have any clue about all that you have been through ? You mentioned having siblings . Please tell me more about your relationship with them .

&gt; This is YOUR time for healing and renewal . No need to thank me for my time. You reached out for help and with a desire to learn how to grow into a better version of yourself and you are worth it!! Continue to believe in yourself by remaining open , speak your truth !! The possibilities are endless!


*If you need any other information regarding those things, let me know.*

*As for how this has affected my views, well. Most of them are not good, except when they are. At my best, I would consider myself an optimistic nihilist. At my worst, I wouldn't know. My view on myself is that I am pointless, worthless, a failure, important to no one in any meaningful way, and completely incapable of doing anything I would enjoy in life, much less anything productive or helpful to others. Except for the times it isn't, where I can acknowledge and even enjoy my strong suits. People actively seek to befriend me and I have had strong relationships.*
*I am aware that I have value to myself and others, and even sometimes enjoy what few things I've done for myself. I've seen some interesting things, been to some interesting places. My opinions and views on literally everything shift from moment to moment, or mood to mood. Life and the world we live in is equaled in beauty only by it's brutality. Fair in its unfairness, harmonious in its discord. In life, one man may experience heaven and for it another man will experience hell. In the end, we are all the same life, being lived out through different circumstances.*

*How I feel largely dictates how I see everything in that particular moment. Sometimes it's balanced and calm, many times it is bitter and indignant. My place in this life it is mine to chose, but there is nothing I have considered that has moved me to the point of choosing to do it. Nothing about myself matters enough that I would ever do anything to better my situation or make my own life one that I would be proud to have lived. Even this may be an attempt to better myself, but it is not FOR myself. I'm doing it because I want to make someone else happier without losing them, to be better FOR THEM, not for me. I do not care about myself.*

*I have only rarely mentioned these things to people. My family knows, but, that's about it. I have told the current woman I am in a relationship with of some of my history, including the abuse, but certainly not most of it. Certainly not the experiences with drugs or some of the worse things I've seen, and done.*

*The relationship with my siblings is strained, at best. I have no idea where to even begin. I grew up with two brothers. One older by a year, one younger by a year. Our path from childhood to adulthood was spent making attempts to murder or inflict serious injury on each other, interspersed with brief moments of kinship. I can honestly say that I have very few, almost zero, good memories of either of them to this day, None of us had doors to our rooms because we kept destroying them, breaking them down each time one of us would start a fight and then run away.*

*There was an occasion I recall where an uncle of ours entered onto an altercation where I had a knife to the throat of my younger brother because he had antagonized me to the point of nearly killing him, meanwhile he laughed uncontrollably having been pleased with himself for doing so. He had once put rusty nails and screws into eggfoam outside my room and caused me to have over fifteen holes in my left foot when I stepped on it not thinking there would be anything in it. The older brother had a bunch of douchebag friends who themselves were basically bullies and awful to be around, and he himself was extremely violent. He was a Juggalo for a good portion of his teen years, if that explains anything.*

*I spent most of my life just trying to avoid the two of them. Hard to do without doors sometimes. I can list our literally hundreds of instances where we were all shitty human beings to each other and those around us. As of typing this, the two of them have had a fight where my younger was knocked unconscious, and beaten, sustaining a possible permanent injury to one of his ankles. I do not know if they'll ever speak again. And I've told both that I don't want to be a part of their shit.*

*When we were older, things got better. But all three of us have always been belligerant about whats been done in the past, and none of us really get along well for long periods of time. A few hours is usually my threshold before I need to be away from them. They can occasionally be good company, but, mostly not.*

*I think that's enough text for this one. I will say, I do not have faith in myself. I do not believe in myself. If I did, I would have done a lot more than I have. I wouldn't be failing every time I make an attempt to find some kind of happiness.*",1,"sexual abuse, trauma"
"I was with a group of friends last night, and another friend started talking to another friend about how many girls secretly liked him and stuff. It was crazy, because no one has ever talked to me about things like that. Then, on the way to the pub, a group of girls basically called me unattractive. Funny how girls are never shy about calling me ugly, but they're apparently too shy to ""approach me"". I never get signals, I've had shit luck on dating sites, no one ever approaches me, no one has ever had a crush on me, and my family are the only people that call me handsome. Nothing tells me that I'm ugly based on how girls treat me versus how they treat other guys.

"I never dreamt it could have lasted this long. It feels like every moment the feelings abate are really only a brief reprieve, the returning torment tears into my psyche with even less remourse. The corruption grows ever inside me, sometimes sleeping only to awake at times it needs to destroy.

The point of trauma feels so far away in time, nearly four years. When the episodes occur, it only feels as it happened just seconds prior. I have no physical ailments, only desolation of the mind. I haven't found an environment for healing, and I don't think I ever will. Isolation is sporadically maddening, not knowing if I'm truly losing my sanity or just feeling the pangs of past wrongdoings. Social circumstances are not helpful to the source of pain, when the episodes occur, all others can sense the turmoil and recoil at the possibility of backlash from this force.

It is a malevolent manifestation of my reality. All manner of action: speech, observation, hearing, all the surroundings are contorted to keep me bound to its dark will. None can even attempt to wrest control of the power it wields, its strength is insurmountable. I'm but a prisoner to its will, the slightest misstep in my path through life it sees an opportunity to grow and infest more within the spirit.

I feel as undeserving to face a plight so dire. It only exists when it feels the possibility to arise. I feel as though an instrument or vessel of its ill conceit. I look into a mirror to see a fair face staring back, crystal blue eyes, a symmetry¬† throughout; many smiles from others abound me in my days, and I feel yet obligated to receive this blessing. My looks yet deceive my emotion, for I know a disgusted figure is writhing within. I cannot tell what yet be unattractive to most: a physical flaw or a scarring of the soul that only seeks to rend into another. I won't let my fellow man that deserve peace be upended in their stable life by a force so reckless.

So I reserve myself, keeping this force of trauma at bay from others, while enduring the suffering of its imprisonment. If love could break its chains that bind itself to me and I to it; it has not yet been gifted from those that radiate beauty throughout, or even a divine power to ease my pain. Society has disillusioned me of the agony I face. I am aware of flaws of the human nature that are best left ignored. Faced against this foe forces my consciousness to the dark reality.

I only wish I had an answer or remedy to this trouble, I fear that none may be found.",1,"Unattractive to most, physical flaw, agony, aware of flaws, best left ignored"

Being truly alone is more painful and impactful than imaginable for most. I am now bitter and fed up with myself and everyone.

"I made another post here before but I deleted it out of nervousness. This'll be my second one. Hope it's okay.

I have felt the worst pain ever due to hating my body. It is a great weight that just burdens me every day. I make it part of my life to protect other people from the repulsiveness. I don't wear anything that's supposed to compliment my body, because quite frankly, it just does the opposite. I could go into so much detail about everything. I hate my face and I hate my body. It is this horrible weight, this impending shame. The only thing I can describe it as is...shame. Horrible, horrible shame. 

I don't even hate my body, I hate what I did to it. I hate myself for abusing my body. It works so hard to keep me alive and I've destroyed it. I hate sitting down because then I feel the fat. I hate feeling my stomach touch my shirt because it reminds me that it protrudes even when I suck it in. I hate that my body's imbalanced, because of course, I was blessed with the small boobs that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE in my family has but me. I'm 50 pounds overweight and I have absolutely nothing. My doctor tells me it's okay (despite the BMI saying I'm obese). She tells me that I'm still in a safe range. My heart isn't in danger and nor is my body. That's a relief, but I still don't feel good.

I feel it's my duty to protect the world from my appearance. I don't want to subject anyone to what I have to see. I know people say that other people aren't looking and don't care, but that doesn't matter to me. I would never want myself looking like how I do in public. I don't wear anything that hugs my body. Some take it as ""modest"", and while I do aim to be modest, it's not because of that. I hate moving and getting out of bed and just talking because of it. I just want to hide from the world and stay in a box of shame and guilt. I hate feeling my stomach exist. I hate my stomach protruding. I hate how clothes cut my body fat in half. I call it the 3 phenomenon because it looks like the shape of 3 from a side view. That's the worst feeling to me. That's what always reminds me. I hate going outside and going into public because of it. I hate looking into the mirror. All I see is a ""sack of pig's flesh"", as I've named it. That phrase seems to be the only one that really captures the repulsiveness, disgust, and shame I feel.

I've dreamed of throwing up multiple times. But I know the dangers. I know it destroys your esophagus permanently. But I still want to fix it. I haven't done anything though. I may never do anything about it, regarding dangerous and reckless actions like throwing up. I know it won't ever be truly fixed, because as soon as I get skinny, then I won't have any good attributes. I don't know how I'll ever find a partner without anything appealing or pretty, because I've already cut the pool down to nearly nothing by waiting till marriage and being cyberschooled/being an absolute hermit. Not to mention also being a huge bitch.

I have tried so many times and I give up because I have no self control. I really think I need to be babysat on my diet. I need someone to keep an eye on me till I'm normal, and then get training to help keep a good lifestyle. I have no willpower. All I have is fear and sadness. Even that doesn't motivate me. I have no energy to be motivated. I've disappointed myself so much. I am a disappointment. I am a failure in so many regards and I am so mad at myself for everything. I live in shame. I have to constantly stare at this ugly sack of pig's flesh. It's caused me so much sadness. I don't want to do anything anymore because it just fills me with sadness adn shame. I don't want to stop existing. I just want to hide. Hide so others don't have to see it. No one has told me my body's beautiful. People just say ""you're not fat"" and I know damn right they're lying. They do that after I start whining and crying. Only then will they reassure me, and I know that's to shut me up. No one has ever actually told me I'm appealing. People have only told me my face is beautiful when I have makeup on. Once boys see me without makeup they stop talking to me (But that may also be cause I'm overbearing and kinda weird).

I don't even know if I should post this. I may actually delete this. Sorry if it's too long. Also, sorry if it sounds narcissistic or vain. I'm not looking for compliments.

Not sure this is the right place for this; I submitted it on r/suicidewatch but there's so many threads on there I fear I won't get any replies.  I need some help and i'm scared to call a suicide hotline for fear of them staging an intervention or some such thing.

This is a first for me -- I've had moments in my life where i've felt close to the edge but things have been really hard recently.

I'll cut to the chase here.

Three years ago I suffered a workplace accident and broke my L3-l4 vertebrae, in addition to my hip. I sustained mid back complications as well that have caused heavy spasms and contusions. I've been fighting workers' comp for all three of these years to get treatment. I got my spine fused two years ago and my hip a little less than a year ago -- while things are better, to the extent that I can walk and such, I live in constant pain and discomfort. I still need to ice my lower and middle back constantly. I recently successfully applied and got invited to my dream job in the Peace Corps, but when I got to medical clearance they told me I couldn't handle the job. This has left me devastated. I thought I could beat this thing through sheer force of will, but my plans have crumbled to nothing and I don't know what to do.

Moreover, I was molested at a Christian summer camp when I was 11 years old and i have never been able to move past it. It has completely impaired my ability to form emotional attachments and even to perform sexually -- not necessarily all the time, but enough that i have blown every chance I've had at romantic normality or happiness. I fear it's messed me up beyond repair.

I am now 25 and tottering under the weight of these burdens. While in the past i've had an active and enjoyable social life and great/varied friends, a mixture of chronic pain and my own personality defects led to me having a very lonely ahd depressing New Year's -- a massive contrast from only a year ago, when I had a pretty damn good time.

The holiday isn't the cause, of course -- it's more just the catalyst to underlying issues I can't seem to beat.

I am lonely. I am in pain. I want desperately to live a normal life but I no longer believe it is possible.

Is there anyone out there who has beaten something like this? What the hell do I do? Where do I turn? How do I overcome this? Is it even worth it? I just want it all to stop.

I would appreciate any advice. I really would. I need 2018 to be different, and I fear it will not be.",1,"Molested, never been able to move past, impaired my ability, to form emotional attachments, even to perform sexually, workplace accident, couldn't handle the job, Lonely, in pain"
"Within the last month, she has lost her best friend and her grandmother, who she was very close with (both passed away). This time last year, she was involved in an incident where she was assaulted (we were not dating at the time), and it is bringing up some bad memories for her. She is continuously mentioning about moving cities on her own, and she keeps insisting she is fine.

"When I was a kid, I was severely bullied. Be we realized why, but I suppose because I could not defend myself and did respond to them with stupid answers, they would target me. When I was in high school, I had 2 friends who were exclusively school friends. They did not care to hang out of school and once school was over, we never saw each other again.

Now years later. Same story. I am not being bullied but people like to talk crap which is inevitable. So I invested time and money in this class. I was traveling somewhere far for it, my classmates were all friendly to me and joking around. Added each other on social media. This class happened to be a short-term one since the teacher was quitting. I thought these people would get close to me and since we were getting along, that they would like to keep in touch. So NOTHING! Again same story as back in high school. I happened to like this guy who did not like me in return and did things to hurt me such as not inviting me to the farewell class party or not asking me to get involved with projects out of class. Then they like each other's pictures on social media but not mine. Then I see some of them coming to my city to visit but they do not care to meet me and hang out.

So why people bother and act so friendly in class but not out of? Is it that they just want to be on good terms and earn something? Why go and act that me and them are friends and we can hang out but when I ask they are all busy? I admit I seemed a little needy. I did not put effort back in school to make friends but this time I did. I was polite, I did ask them about their goals, tried to be around and active, liked their posts on social media. Only thing is that I had a fight with the guy I liked and everyone liked him in class, so most likely he spoke nonsense. 

I just feel very disappointed. Any advice?",1,"Bullied, did things to hurt, not inviting me to the farewell class party disappointed"
"It sucks because a flaw about your personality can easily be fixed and I doubt it has a strong impact. Being reminded constantly of body flaws is the worse in my opinion because that can just ruin someone completely. It just hits you in the heart because that's what everyone views you as.

"I'm not talking about our misconstrued constructs about what's morally acceptable. I'm talking about the hypocrisy and the pretentiousness, the megalomania that grips each and every person. I mean, everyone is so full of shit. We pretend to care about others, and want others to care about us, but it's not because we actually care. It's because we're the only thing that matters. As soon as it becomes convenient, we throw others to the side. So long as we can get our chemical fix, we'll slave away until the day we die, spouting bullshit and pretending as if things actually matter. Hell, we even have the ego to assume we have some kind of superiority over other living creatures. Are we not animals? Sorry, but just because we are subjectively more intelligent, doesn't mean our existence is any less futile or has any more meaning. Sorry to break it to you, but God's not real, and why would you even want him to be? (i may be inserting my preconceived notions as fact, but in theme with this post, Idgaf if you disagree) 
     On this subreddit, we all pretend to sympathize with each other, but I bet in real life we are all judgemental sacks of shit, and I'm willing to bet that because I know I certainly am. I like to spout about the woes of man, but in real life, I'm a slave to the emotional parts of my brain, an introvert with no social skills, humor, or personality. I don't explain this for pity btw, I explain this because I'm quite the hypocrite, and I'm willing to bet you are too. People who complain about gender inequality annoy me. People who complain about racial inequality annoy me. I'm a selfish prick, sure. But so are you. So stop forcing me to pretend to care about you? I have my own worthless ideals that I care about, and that you don't. For example, I think there is a ridiculous age inequality. For what reason should age be used as an indicator of expected respect? If you're a fucking idiot, and don't cater to my selfish wants, I'm not going to fucking respect you. I might be *age* and a know it all, but that doesn't guarantee I don't fucking know more than you. Even if I don't, everyone shouldn't just assume I don't and treat me like a fucking child, but then expect me to act like an adult. Are you fucking kidding me with the hypocrisy?
Oh, but even though you don't take my issue seriously, I should take racism seriously because it affects you personally and you would like to feed your ego.


I wasted enough time venting for no reason. Time to go waste my time working after staying up late for no reason. I don't really know what the point of this post was, but I feel like there was a general theme to it.

"For the past few years I've been feeling more and more miserable and depressed and I don't know why.

Things that used to make me happy now just leave me feeling empty. I think my last truly happy day was my wedding day 1.5 years ago, which isn't great for a 28 year old guy I guess.

I think the speed at which things feel like they are getting worse seems to increase which each ""episode"", if you can call it that, where I normally have some kind of break down.

I feel like I'm trapped inside my own head, even though I know I should do something, or sometimes even want to do something I just can't. I'm telling myself to get up of the couch and do those things, but my body just doesn't seem to respond. Instead I just sit there and accomplish nothing.

I used to be so much more positive, I completely changed my career in retail to be a web developer and worked my way up to be in charge of my own team. I always fought my way through the pressure and got really far in my career at a young age and then at some point this all started.

Food is a side affect as well as a cause of a lot of my problems. As I'm so unable to get the motivation to do anything, I normally just order takeout rather than cooking food. Which in turn just makes me feel more guilty and the cycle continues.

It's strange, I image if you asked anybody that I work with or any of the few friends that I have they probably all think I'm a happy, outgoing person. The only person who knows is my wife and even then I'm not sure she knows the extent of how I feel. I also don't want to put extra pressure on her as she has dealt with depression before as well. She eventually went to her GP and they gave her some medication that has definitely made a difference to her outlook on life.

This was a while ago but it made me think that maybe I could get up the willpower to go to the doctors and see if they could help me. This morning I made an appointment with the doctor and I thought things might be looking up, but it didn't take long for things to come crashing down to an all time low.

When I got there they said they had been trying to call me all morning because they had to cancel my appointment since the doctor hadn't turned up. Annoying as it may be this should a reasonable excuse. Instead, I could feel myself stood at reception falling apart inside.

Every now and then I've had thoughts like ""Would things be better if I weren't here"" and afterwards I always said to myself that even though I'd thought it I'd never do something like that.

As I was walking home from the doctors, probably about 20 feet from my street where I had to cross over, it hit me. I was considering just walking straight into the road and I didn't even care. I was actually disappointed when I got to the edge of the path and there weren't any cars coming.

I got in the house and had a massive panic attack, I couldn't breath, then I was probably the most angry I've ever been and throwing things about and screaming at things. I didn't know if I was more annoying at myself for wanting to do it, or for not actually doing it.

I've calmed down a bit now and I've apparently got an emergency appointment with a different GP but all of this only happened about an hour ago and I just don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

"Turns out no self-esteem for years really ruins your life. Due to this I developed major and chronic depression. Know exactly what I need to do, can't do it.

You don't just rebuild self-esteem over days, weeks, months, or even years. This takes decades. 

Decades of kindness, decades of acceptance, decades of love. It's real hard to get that as someone who feels like every breath is robbing another of oxygen.

Pretty sure it's game over for my mental health. Oh well. Maybe I can learn to live without these things but 4+ years of trying make me weary, y'know.

"I'm 30 and have been depressed since 15, the age at which I realized I wasn't going to be tall and handsome and gave up on life. I get worse whenever I see porn, since I chastise myself for not having the genetics to date and bang hot women. I asked an aesthetics forum to rate pictures of me, they said 6-7, but it means almost nothing to me if it's not 9.

The one thing that keeps me from killing myself is thinking about how I could change my life around. I'm currently selling my stuff so I can afford lasik, then braces to fix my teeth. I'd also love to get limb lengthening on my legs by 3"" to make me about 6', but I have a small head and worry that I won't look good. I've done research on how to apply for gene therapy clinical trials and other radical reconstruction. I honestly don't care what the complications would be, I'm THAT unhappy. I think about suicide already, and I would end it if it happened to not work out.

I wasted a lot of time before realizing this ""my way or bust"" mindset, and I hope anyone younger than me can take away that you'll regret not solving your problems sooner if you don't start now.

"I feel a bit better with the drugs out of my system. I spent new year's morning on the beach till sunrise.

"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant (this doesn't sound rediculous when you're 13). By this point everyone at my school thinks I've gone mad or that I'm truly in denial about my skin. I wasn't, I was telling them genuinely what I thought was true. 

     When i turned 14, my parents got into a pretty hairy argument that was pretty normal at the time. My mom would be upset that my dad caught one of her lies, and she would make herself seem like the victim. My dad was pissed that she could easily make everyone feel so sorry for her (even if she was in the wrong), and he looked me straight in the eye and told me ""I'm not your real father"". I never cry... ever. But when the man tgat raised you you're entire life can just flick you off his shoulder like that. That... shit... destroyed... me.

     Turns out, my mother cheated on father she was dating my father for 5 years, and she accidentally conceived me. She tried to keep it a secret from the family and even my father.... and idk how, but she managed to keep everyone fooled. According to my cousins, aunts, and uncles, everyone already knew. She told the ENTIRE family to keep the truth from me.

    While i was in school, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. Not because i was mixed, but because I spent 2 years trying to convince everyone i was white. After this whole situation, there were two different kinds of people at my school. People that could capitalize on my misery, and the people that would sympathize me. Both of these kind of people disgust me.

     I'm 22 now and i moved out of my mothers home and now I really feel hopeless. I don't have a lot of friends, I don't feel as if I can trust anyone really. I hate the feeling of being manipulated, but i also hate the feeling of being alone. I'm beyond confused and idk how to fix myself.

TL:DR - My mother cheated on my father and I'm a result of it. I wasn't told that my father wasn't my biological father until i was 14 and it's a curse that wont go away",1,"middle school, everyone would point out how """"black"""" i was (My family is all white, and i happen to be slightly darker,would tell my mother about how upset it made me,She said that I was slightly darker because she drank lot's of pepsi when she was pregnant, truly in denial about my skin,my mother cheated on father,she accidentally conceived me"
"I mean, it's fucking awful man, I remember I used to help people left an right, and now, I don't know, I make people cry for no good reason, I feel fucking awful, I know that I shouldn't be so mean to everyone, I know that they're only trying to help, but I only know it afterwards, I only understand afterwards that I was a huge asshole, but never in the moment, and I hate it.


The feeling doesn't even stay, I make someone cry, then apologize for it because I start to understand what I'm doing, and then the next day I'm confused why I apologized, and rinse and repeat. 


The only time I feel somewhat normal is after being angry and making someone cry, because afterwards, I just can't think, my head is empty, and, it's somewhat peaceful, I don't know


I remember being there for everyone when they needed help, but now? Before they didn't even have to ask for help, I'd see it, but now? I couldn't care less about anything or anyone for that matter

"There's no sugarcoating it really. I have a history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor. I'm 18 now and everything was going great since my birthday (septemeber). I was about to graduate, I had a girlfriend I adored, friends always wanting to do something, and I just generally felt happy. Until early December when my abuser came back into my life ( and I'm too much of a bitch to tell amyone other than my best friend ), one of my friends became toxic and we've slowly distanced, and then my girlfriend dumped me. I was actually dealing with everything well enough but her dumping me was the straw that broke the fragile camel's back. Short anecdote, but my first girlfriend and I broke up in April. I being a vulnerable 17 year old idiot, decided to go on tinder and just find someone, someone who could fill that void. Instead of dating though I just fucked. And not in a good ""I'm having so much sex it feels great!"" kinda way, but more in a last ditch effort for a sense of validity and feeling wanted, followed by complete resentment and disgust in myself afterwards. My current ex helped me not live like this anymore back in June, but then she ended things on the 27th. It was after a long text about all my problems that was induced by a severe overload of anxiety. I don't feel like she's not justified, I just wish I hadn't sent her that. My mind instead of talking it out or anything instead defaulted to my old habits. It's been one week and I've had a one night stand with three different people. I hate it, I never feel macho or confidence boosted after just gross and shameful.

Sex and I have always sorta been like that though. I mentioned my abuser, in short she molested and raped me multiple times through blackmail when I was 15. That's how I lost my virginity. I get that society places too much of an emphasis on it but my first sexual experience was while I was crying, screaming for her to stop, and being berated. I would have preferred better. So after then I just stopped caring about it or myself and just did it whenever I was with someone willing to do such. I always convince myself though, that the person I'm about to have sex with will be someone I want to be with, but that's never the case, yet I keep falling for it. I feel like a sociopath, I keep using other people for a fucked up sense of emotional relief, a way to forget about my ex-girlfriends, to forget about how much I used to care, and to convince myself I've always been this way, I just hided it.

I don't even know if half of this makes sense. I'm not even fully aware of why do it to be honest I think I'm addicted but I'm too terrified to admit that. This is more me just venting about being a manipulative cunt. Rarely do people ever actually read what I post, which usually leads to me deleting them, but if anyone is reading this, can you just tell me if I'm a horrible person for doing this because I can't help but feel as such.",1,"history of being abused, neglected, and living very poor"
"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?",1, horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen.
"I should have done this a long time ago.

Let me begin by saying that I am a proud man.  I like to think I'm self-sufficient, and that I'm equipped to deal with the crap the world throws at me.  I'm not accustomed to asking for help, especially when it comes to my illness.  You see, no one in my family knows I suffer from chronic depression, because I have never been diagnosed as such.  But the truth is I've spent the majority of my entire life battling self-loathing, feelings of hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide.  And as I slog through what must certainly be a mid-life crisis, it's getting harder and harder to deal with on my own.

I am very slight of build, and I was bullied mercilessly as a child and teenager.  I learned to fight back, and have spent most of my life unwilling to put up with others' crap.  That has really hurt me socially and professionally, because everyone thinks I'm an asshole.  I'm now in my 40s, and I don't have any friends anymore, and don't really have much to do with my family, other than my mother.  I love her, and she loves me, but she's a tyrant.  She has supported me financially for years, and she's not afraid to remind me of that at every opportunity.  She's approaching her 70s now, and her health is deteriorating, leaving me as the only member of the family who would even consider caring for her (everyone else in my family draws disability or welfare, even though they're each perfectly capable of working, but none of them would lift a finger to care for my mother, so that falls on me).

I went to college, where I did very well.  I have a bachelors degree in music education, but after graduating I discovered fairly quickly that I can't stand children (much less their overbearing parents).  So I am now thousands of dollars in debt (student loans) that I can't afford to pay, all for a degree in which turned out to be a waste of time. I was never a particularly stellar performer, so that avenue is closed to me as well.  However, I've spent the past 20 years writing and arranging music for school bands and band instruments in a bid to validate going to college in the first place and salvage some sort of professional career, and some dignity.  Unfortunately, composing and arranging pays little to no money...certainly not enough to pay bills or better myself.  The truth is, I'm an outcast in that world, because again, I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to tell music teachers when they're not doing a good job.  So I feel that door has closed as well.

Since graduating college, I've had to resort to what amounts to a string of odd jobs which I've absolutely hated.  Customer service, human resources, retail, grocery, sales....all soul-crushing, tedious jobs that have always made me feel like a complete and utter failure in life, and wishing that writing music was a sustaining career.  

About 10 years ago, I got involved in a relationship with a woman who nearly ruined my financially.  It took me a long time to bounce back from that, but I did.  I had to move back home, though.  Unfortunately, since then, I've had an incredibly difficult time finding work at all.  I live in the rural south, where the only good paying jobs are in nursing and truck driving (neither of which I can do, nor would ever want to).  I can't even get a job flipping burgers or working in a grocery store, because I'm a man in my 40s with a degree, and am (according to employers and staffing managers) overqualified for anything short of, according to them, brain surgery.  Factories won't hire me for the same reason (and also because I cannot lift more than 40 pounds).  I'm subscribed to dozens of different job websites, and can't count the number of times I've nearly been scammed by fraudulent job listings...the sort that prey upon desperate people like me.  I've wasted thousands of dollars in gasoline driving to places of business in order to apply, only to be told ""You have to apply online"", and am then ridiculed by friends and family who assert ""You have to go meet employers face to face if you want to get hired"".  

In the past I've actually moved around the country in order to find work, but I've always been held back by 1). There's no such thing as a permanent full time job anymore, and 2). The extremely high cost of living, and anyway, as my mother gets older, that's no longer an option.  I'm stuck here, and I'm going broke.  If it weren't for my mother, I would be homeless, and just a few days ago she informed me that ""we're"" moving from a decent house in a quiet neighborhood to a mobile home next to a railroad....the last thing in the world my ego and self-esteem need right now.

I don't have health insurance.  I can't even afford it.  The state I live in doesn't offer Medicaid,  the premiums are too expensive on even the cheapest plans, and the copays at my local health department are too expensive.  My student loan is on deferment until they get tired of me requesting deferments (which may very will be next month).  I've been dealing with internal and external hemorrhoids for a decade, and I can't afford even have them looked at, much less do anything about it.  And I certainly can't afford therapy, or counseling, or medication for this depression.   Coupled with the fact that I don't even want to get out of bed most days, combined with the fact that I'm not getting any younger...I'm beginning to see the writing on the wall.

I'm a proud man.  I don't like to ask for help.  I don't want to apply for welfare or financial assistance, because 1). I most likely wouldn't qualify for it, and 2). to me, that's admitting total defeat, and surrendering any shred of dignity I have left.  I certainly don't like to ask for help from strangers on the internet, because frankly, I think it's a total waste of time and effort.  But I can feel a darkness creeping up on me, preparing to strangle the very life out me.  I see no hope for a future.  It just makes me so angry.  I don't drink, I don't do drugs, I've stayed out of trouble, and I don't bother anyone.  I worked very hard to better myself and, for my part, I've been a good person.  I don't care about money or wealth.  I just want a sense of purpose in life.  I want to be able to pay my bills and actually buy things I want rather than just what I need.  I want to be respected for my talents, and maybe even remembered when I'm gone.  But all of that seems totally out of reach now.  It's infuriating to see my suggested earning potential on job sites ($89,000 per year, btw), and then get a prospectus from Social Security letting me know that as of right now, when I turn 65 I'll only get $330 a month.  That makes it feel like everything, my education, my work history, my entire life...has all been for nothing.

I don't know what to do.  I applied for over 20 jobs today, and I won't hear back from a single employer because I'm a forty-something with a college degree.  I'm tired of being supported financially by my ailing mother.  I want to support HER.  I want to be able to afford an apartment at the very least, and not have to move into a damn trailer less than 20 feet from railroad tracks.  I want her to be proud of me.  I want my college professors to be proud of me.  I want to be proud of myself.  

But part of me also wants off this ride.  Part of me is afraid things are not going to get better.  How can they?  I'm running out of ideas.  I'm running out of options.  And I'm running out of patience.  I just don't know what else to do.

"Nothing Happens


Staring at the white wall I trace the rectangular patterns with my wet eyes and the pain strikes me again along with the voices. ‚ÄúGaby, you‚Äôre such a fuck up why are you even alive?‚Äù I cover my ears while I shake my head repeatedly. I lose control. In a plane falling out of the sky what can one do but brace for death? Every negative happening that‚Äôs ever happened is replaying in my head, spun around where I‚Äôve become the problem. The angle of death. The one thing that makes sure everything goes wrong. I see this seemingly true image of myself and I feel disgusted. The voices start yelling ugly words at me digging at my festering wrists. They wanna see blood but I wont give it to them. My whole body shaking, little puddles of tears on the floor, eyes like a madwoman the voices start screaming. Banging my head against the wall until my fight for survival becomes a fight for death I slump down, my head throbbing with a sharp pain in my skull. I laugh.

"Hey all.  
Sorry if I seem like I'm just dumping a lot here, I just feel I need help thinking through some issues. 

The big thing is a pretty damaging vicious cycle. I'm awful depressed because I'm lonely and feel I'm the only guy my age (22) who hasn't dated anyone, or even had any close friends I could trust and talk to. Never really hung out with anyone. Though I wish to change that and make a few friends in college, but not only do I not know how to go about it even though it's my third year, but I just feel that nobody would care about me. In fact, everyone from high school completely forgot about me, even before graduation, and we're a small class and everyone knows everyone's name. 

There's a lot of things that drift through my mind when I try to work through this, and I just get overwhelmed.  

A number of things leave me feeling worthless about myself.  

I happen to be mildly autistic, which honestly I don't understand much about it, but in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded, even a few that knew I was just like any of them. I should be able to just get over that, but... you can only wonder if people are telling you that you're intelligent and capable out of pity so many times before you start getting paranoid.  

Plus, I see tons of other people who seem to have good friends they're always hanging out with, but I never know how to introduce myself to someone, honestly I'm scared I'll make an ass of myself. Enough that I literally get paralyzed when I try to talk to someone, my jaw seizes up and everything. But I'm ok with people approaching me, which never seems to happen, it's only happened once in my life. This makes me think, is the easier problem to fix that I struggle starting conversations, or that nobody wants to talk to me? 

I've got pretty bad image issues, too... I know that it's almost impossible to find a guy who'll say it, but there it is. I won't say I'm a heavy guy, because I don't look particularly bulky, but I... look up gynecomastia and you got me. I look like I've got boobs, and yes I'm a man and *hell* no, I'm not trans. I've been trying to work out and loose them, but while I've been loosing some weight they're not really being affected. I'll never look good in a tee shirt like this, it seems, and that's kinda why I'm struggling to start an athletic lifestyle... again, vicious cycle I gotta break out of. 

Lots of things to work through here... I feel absolutely overwhelmed. ",1,"happen to be mildly autistic, in school, word spread about it and plenty of people started talking to me as though I was retarded,"
"I hate myself, i hate everything I am.  I wish I didn't.  Or maybe I really don't.  Maybe I just can't take the negative thoughts, the pain, the apathy, the endless battle you can never win anymore.  I feel like I'm worthless, like I mean nothing to anyone.  I'm always trying to live up to impossible expectations from a person that doesn't exist.  I hurt, and hurt, and hurt and hurt so much that my heart may as well explode and nothing changes.  I go to bed, I wake up the next day and repeat that for however long I get to till I'm back here.  Knowing that there will never be a point where I don't come back here till the day I die.  

Why don't I get to be normal?  Why don't I get to be happy without the looming sadness and anger?  What did I do to deserve this?  Is it because I exist?  Not letting me live wasn't enough punishment.

"So I have been effed up in life several times. I've got quite a background with depression , rejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed, like there is no way out of this.

I've been struggling with paradoxical feelings, because I met a girl who I've fallen in love with, but she has bpd and got a full time job. We rarely speak now, only in March will she be available again. She makes me feel good about myself, like the only thing that truly makes me happy. I care about her so much, so I am letting her set her life straight and not talk to her. She's rarely in the mood anyways, as she gets home too tired to talk or too depressed. She told me she loves me, but she's not ready for a relationship yet. I'd love to heal her and make her happy, regardless of being in a relationship with her or not. I just want her to be happy. That alone, would make things better.

I struggle with some kind of mental illness. I can't say what it is, since I've never been diagnosed. I believe, however that I have depression and/ or avpd.

Also, she lives in another country and I'm scared that if I meet her in person, things will change. Like, she will stop liking me. I'm very awkward in real life and can't express a fourth of what I write.

I'm scared of completely deliver my heart to her, although I do trust her. But, I just have a feeling that she may not want it, since she mentioned she's not ready for a relationship yet.

She's been with abusive exes and has a rough past, which is no wonder she is trying to protect herself.

So what should I do? We are both afraid, but we love each other. We are planning to eventually meet up one day. But that is what scares us. We are afraid of hurting each other and being hurt. Maybe because it may won't work out, not because we would actually hurt each other.

She's my everything. This is the first time I felt such strong feelings. I am numb on the inside, but when I am with her, all my demons fade away.

It frustrates me being so useless to her. I want to do something for her, but she's been to busy. We haven't spoken in more than a week. It will probably carry on till March or something.

I've been severely depressed. Talking to close friends helps a bit, but my closest friends are online friends. My real life friends are not that close and I don't feel comfortable with them.

The darkest thoughts have been running through my mind, and I've been idealizing suicide lately. The only thing that keeps me from doing it is that I have family who loves me, and I have online friends who are also family to me. If I ever did it, they would not know about it, I'd just become inactive forever, and that would certainly pain them more than my family since they would not know if I was dead or not.

Even so, I don't know how long I'll last. Don't mean to be pessimistic, but things aren't looking okay. I feel like my feelings don't make sense and that my thoughts are too confusing. It's becoming unbearable ",1,ejection and bullying. I'm 21 and I feel like my life is already doomed
"My adventure with depression started at start of middle school. I went to new school with many thugs. I am a quiet, peaceful, so I was bullied harshly - like throwing lit matches at me, laughing at my acne, once whole gym with 70 people laughed, because I couldn't make a simple exercise, dog barked when we were coming back from school and they said ""Even dog doesn't like you"". To add fuel to the fire, when I came back home parents were screaming at each other, because of my alcoholic father and financial problems. I was totally alone with all the problems and it seemed like whole world is against me.

After few months I changed school with ""normal"" people not thugs. However something changed in me. The world was dark, I had negative thoughts about myself, world and others 24/7 like ""I am worthless"", ""People are evil and want to use me"", ""People are suffering around the world"". I had nightmares everynight like I was holding injured man on apocalyptic landscape and there was an atomic alarm, on the sky there was a sign ""magnetic field can kill you"" then I woke up screaming, but the real world looked like in this nightmare. There was no escape. At start I fought with it, but after a while I accepted this dark world. I watched dark movies, listened to dark ambient etc. This lasted 6 years. I tried many SSRI's, but nothing worked. 

At the end of high school I started experimenting with dissociatives like ketamine. They helped me a little, but at the end of school I tried to commit suicide and was sent again to psychiatrist. He gave me venlafaxine and it was miracle. It changed my world in 30 minutes, color started to be brighter, mental pain wasn't there, no negative thoughts, doing things started to be pleasurable again. I mixed it with dissociatives, because there are studies linking ketamine as useful with depression treatment. Now, after 3 years I don't use ketamine or SSRI's and my world looks like heaven. I feel good all the time, no negative thoughts, have motivation to do things, colors are bright, no nightmares, normal self-esteem (while in depression I thought that I was a complete shit and shouldn't even breath, because of waste of oxygen).

No one has ever asked me "" hey wanna hang out"" or "" reach this video game"" or something like that. I always had to make the first move. I'm tired of this shit, I wanna kms right now


Edit: Well what did I say",1,"Back in school the only time I would get attention is if someone wants me to do something, or for bullying me, In highschool and college, everyone just ignores me"
"I grew up being raped and molested by my step dad from age 5 to 11 and once by an uncle at age 7. I have witnessed 7 suicides in my life, 4 of them infront of me and the others I walked in on after it was done. I have been beaten daily till I was bleeding or my step dad got tired of hitting me from age 5 to 17. I was homeless from 18 to 27, I never knew my real dad but for a few months before he died of liver failure, I was 23, then at 25 my mother committed suicide. at the age of 37, I have PTSD and severe depression and severe social anxiety. 

for the past 8 years I have been on this site and many others trying to find someone to build a connection with, get close too, make memories with, share things with, eventually build a life together and become a serious couple that settled down.

For the past 8 years I have been told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, told I have nothing to offer anyone, told I don't deserve love or a relationship or a woman, told I need to kill myself.

For the past 8 years I have been lead on by a couple women who pretended like they wanted me and was interested in me and after 5 or 6 months of this, they would fake their death or call me having sex with someone or disappear then turn around and stalk me.

I have been rejected over 2 thousand times in the past 8 years all because I am obese, I struggle with low thyroid, a very slow metabolism, and genetics from both parents being obese, and just found out that I have very low testosterone, although I have a high sex drive. All of these issues plus my PTSD effects my weight and makes a breeding ground for obesity as my Dr. has put it. I walk 3 miles a day, I eat healthy, baked chicken, boiled veggies, etc. I stay away from soda pops but once a week I will drink a soda, once a month I will eat a pint of ice cream. it helps me stay on track and away from fast food and deep fried stuff. But it doesn't matter, because of my health issues that are causing the obesity.

But see, yet no one wants to get to know that about me, no one wants to get to know anything about me, they just see the outside of me and what income I have then reject me. No one cares for who I am as a person, no one cares for how I am as a person, no one cares what I am like as a person, no one cares about my personality or attitude. No one cares how I would treat them. They just see my weight then walk away.

I may not have much in the looks department to offer, I may not have much in the money department to offer. But what I did have to offer was pure true unconditional love, true loyalty, a heart filled with pure love and a mind filled with acceptance and understanding. someone who wouldn't ever cheated or left, or ever played mind games, someone who would been so loyal to you, someone who would have treated you with gentle care and love. someone who would been very romantic and devoted.

Well, I give up looking, I am done looking. I am to the point I just don't care if I ever find anyone or ever be with anyone. well this is my good bye letter to all the women on here. I hope many of you who I crossed paths with are proud of yourselves for how you did me and how you treated me. and for those of you who I never talked too, sorry we never got a chance. if you would have given me one.

I am just done with it all. I just can't take anymore and am ending it tonight.

"Hello there.

First of all, this isn't an 'emergency' or something, I'm not suicidal and I know I'll get over this depression, but maybe somebody can help make it quicker.

I'm a 27 year old male and about 5 months ago I lost the parent who raised me. I was fat most of my life, except for a few years when I was a teen. I'm 5'10 (178cm) and 285 pounds (130kg) atm, I'm really unhappy with my body and my voice. I'm not handsome by any standard and I'm poor too (and I'm getting bald).

Recently I fell in love for a girl but she lives in US and she's smart and beautiful, I'm from western Europe and I don't have the money to go to US. If I had the means to go I'd surely at least try even though I know I'd probably be rejected (like, 99.9% of chance). I have a lot of responsibilities here too. I'm losing weight but it's probably going to take a few months/years to reach my ideal and even when that happens I guess I'll have loose skin. The fact is: I wouldn't want to date someone like me, how can I expect others to? Please don't come up with that acceptance thing, although I really appreciate the good intentions I just can't change what my brain finds attractive or not.

I've never been with a girl I loved ( or not :P ), I've only loved 3 girls so far, one when I was 17 and I was slim and such, but I didn't have the balls to express my feelings. Then again when I was I guess 20 or something, I wasn't very obese so I was somewhat OK with my weight, but the girls was from Australia and we didn't even have the time to know each other better.

People keep saying that's a 'crush' or something, but that's a start isn't it? I mean, I don't feel like approaching girls I don't feel something strong for and I totally don't believe 'real long-lasting love' will emerge from a forced relationship. A girl once wanted to approach me (but I was in love with that 2nd girl) so I suppose I'm not unbearably ugly but I certainly can't compete with the other guys in terms of looks.

I've been working my 'bottom' off for some time now, and I hope to make some money to be financially comfortable, but I don't want a girl to like me because of that, while I surely plan to use some of the money to improve myself.

I like smart girls with strong political opinions and definitely I don't like 'good' girls that are OK with everything and always trying to avoid conflicts. This girls I'm in love with really seems the perfect match, I honestly never been so sure about that, but I simply can't have her.

So, this is the situation I'm facing at the moment, my heart aches so much but I don't express it to others. I don't have anyone to talk about that only my dog and although that helps a bit it doesn't count much.

I'm trying to focus on my work to forget her but I can't. Everything I see feels familiar in a way that reminds her, this is something I never felt before, even looking at this text somehow I remind her face. Maybe there's a hormonal imbalance or something. I'm certainly not discarding the possibility of a physiological effect.

So, sorry for the big text and thank you for reading it. I'd really appreciate any advice on that. Thank you very much.

"Hey, /r/Depression/ . I'm not sure whether I want to post here or in /r/SuicidalWatch/ as I'm having mixed feelings.

I'm from the type of people who pays attention to the detail, so let me give you some background. I'm a 19-y-o boy working as a waiter, which job was wrapped up by my grandmother. Yeah, living with my parents, and grandparents. I'm living in a very advanced level of poverty... even this is a miracle considering the chances, in my country, of being employed solely on a diploma.
This is the job I've started off after living 4 months of unemployment. I really f|cking prefer living my whole live unemployed, rather than being employed in such a sh|tty job. ""Why don't you just change your job? Or the very least, change the workplace?"" It's not as simple as that. No one hires. This just as in, because you really do need a good certification or degree from (preferably) the... richest... places. E.g. Microsoft certification, or an Oxford degree.
Now let me tell you about the job I'm stuck on working. Every. goddamn. day. And I'm almost wanting to cry typing this, because it only reminds me of what I'll have to face tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and et cetera. I don't like my job, because co-workers, I don't like the F&amp;B Manager (Food and Bar Manager), I don't like the boss, and the clients, towards which I force myself to have positive feelings, because I'm a waiter, and this is a positive, and a default trait.
I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-workers, but very experienced in the field. It's because I'm new and know nothing about this genre. No one teaches me anything regarding how to work, and how to work the work. When I try to do something on my own, I usually fail, because no one offers a hand (referred as to teaching), then the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me, and feel a relief telling me ""You aren't good for anything. Better quit this job as soon as you can. It's the same even if you're working. You're only causing troubles, and issues."" 
A usual worker would think, ""Well, it's not an estimation by a manager."" But the thing is, my co-workers are very close with the manager, and always whine to him how I'm not good for anything. If I try to 'raise my voice' (figuratively), I always get a huge backlash of bullshit. I.e. there has been a problem, and I'm not in fault, but if it is in correlation with the experienced co-workers, it usually is my fault. Kind of a handicap. It got to a point where my manager cuts a lot of tasks, duties, and obligations, because I'm 'incompetent'. Today he saw me trying to carry 2 things at once, and got irritated, then told me by a very unpleased voice and body language 'Just stop trying to multi-task.' But I usually am good in multi-tasking, but the cowardice feeling (anxiety closy-by [It's really not anxiety, but I really do get VERY scared]) of having someone around me that watches what I'm doing, and probably expects the failure. And it really increases the chance of failure.
I really do have a friend of mine in the staff, but this can't really compensate anything. I have (had) friends, with which I've lost contact long time ago, and basically what I'm doing in life currently is go home, sleep, and to work again.

[#The Having Positive Feelings Towards Thoughts Of Death]
I usually watch entertaining or educational videos, which I've watched before, but the difference is that now I don't feel anything. I just feel depression, which cannot leave me. When watching utensils, I get a little uplifting feeling, which is caused by thoughts of harming myself. I really can't do anything about it, nor can you. The premise is that I want to get A LOT of weight off of my burden.

This is the life I'm living. Handicapped. It literally feels like you're tied, and can do nothing else, but to accept hard hits. Thank you for paying attention... not even the guests of the hotel are That merciful.",1,"I'm an outsider working with not-so-intelligent co-,the staff of the whole hotel (the workplace) gather togheter, talking to each other that I'm incompetent, I'm stupid, they laugh at me"
"Sorry, this is my first reddit post ever because I'm really good at lurking but not at contributing to anything. I'm starting my second semester of college at IUS soon, and I'm really excited because it's my only way I get to go out and do things besides staying home and slowing drifting towards wanting to die. 

Every day I hope I make a new friend but I realize I'm wrong and I go home feeling like shit because I feel like everyone thinks I'm as shitty I as I feel I am. I asked this guy I liked out after I embarrassed myself the day before and I fucked everything up; I lost all chance of dating I had with him. Everyday is just another day for me to feel lonely. On the last day of drawing class we had I started violently crying before class at my easel because I'm a weak piece of shit. I got a 3.5 gpa on my first semester back though and that makes me feel really happy.

I can't even think of what to say when I try to talk to people; I always draw blanks in my mind and I end up just awkwardly being there with nothing to say and nothing to contribute. I'm only able to be friends with people who are able to put up with my shit and are able to put effort into being with me because I'm barely putting enough effort into being alive.

I still have hope though that good things will happen to me and make me feel like I'm an actual person and not a corpses that just goes day to day doing nothing. 

I'm also going to this sleepover thing for the new years and I hope I'm able to make friends.

"Grades. Looks. Achievements. Medals. Friends.

The inferiority complex. That second word ... the word carries so much weight

It's like an endless competition against the world. 

Every day, every minute, every breathe, it feels like a competition.

A gladiator match. A Hunger Games type of feel.

It's a big war on who has the biggest dick.

Every minute, I compare with others about everything.

How managed to get what they wanted at a much earlier age than I do. 
How they manage to get a hold of their own life but I ever did. 

How much I keep comparing grades *(which is my greatest weakness because I focus on it too much on a daily basis but I end getting bad grades anyway because my anxiety keeps killing me ... makes me procrastinate and black out and give up)*

Every day I am shaking the minute I wake up. 

Every day, I feel like I have this need, this compulsion, this must to be better than everyone else in every way ... but I am too weak. 




I am paralysed in that endless competition against others and everyone else in this world goddamned planet and at the same time, I lack the slighest motivation to even do the slightest change because I give up before I even do anything because I have an inferiority complex, one that I feel like I am an ant among giants or gods.

*(or when I did make a move to be better, I pushed so much that it took over my life. An obsession that became so invasive and destructive that instead of my mind verbally and psychologically abusing me in one way, I allowed it to abuse me in a different way. When I did want to make a change, I went too far and it became dysfunctional)*

In my head, I feel like I am at war. I feel like I am in an endless bloody nightmare against my own head. Sometimes, I even lay down my arms before it starts because I am too exhausted and fed up of fighting over and over and over and over again.

On the outside, I feel frozen. I am shaking every day. Even right now, I am shaking because I am constantly being reminded on how much of a pathetic, weak and ungrateful little bastard I am because no matter how much I try, no matter how much I wanted to push myself, I never am able to do it.

When I try to be better, I fuck up. I panic, I feel like giving up, I feel like I running through a battlezone where there are a thousand bombs exploding everywhere, terrified as hell. I feel little and weak and scared.

I feel like I am walking on a thin rope but I am shaking because I am scared. 

I feel like a thousand voices are screaming inside my head constantly all the time. They make me shake even more and because of that, I end up falling

Again. And again and again.

Sometimes, I even fall on purpose because I want to hurt myself because even though I have that compulsion to be better, I give up immediately.

It's like when there is a bully who is about to beat me, I beat myself instead just to save the time and energy and because I deserve it.

So I do that over and over and over again. From the minute I wake up. Every minute, I feel like I am in a battle between myself and my self hatred and more often than not, my self hatred wins.

So I beat myself. Over and over again.

And then I keep noticing how much I hate myself and because of that, I feel pathetic. I feel despicable.

And when I compare myself to others, that is the perfect fuel to add to the fire that is already burning me from the inside while I am tied up with my mouth shut.

I sit on my chair or stay on my bed, staring at the wall, or looking at the paper that I am supposed to write. I end up staring at it for hours, because I even lack that tiniest skills or the tiniest effort to push myself to even do it. But even if I did try, I know that I don't want to ""just try"", I want to go all out. 100%. ... No, 200%. 300%. I want to be the best. The best of the best. But I feel pathetic either way. So, I don't do much effort. 

So I get bad grades or fail .... another perfect fuel to the fire. 

My mind feels like it hit the gold mine. It has the perfect tools to make its bitch. It has me chained like an animal and it slaps and belittles every minute.

I look at others, I don't see people, I see numbers and qualities, those who have beaten me, those who I need to beat, those who I am already better than them and those who I absolutely can never beat.

All of them, my mind will still find ways to make its bitch even more.

____________________________________________________

Every day I go through this. Every day I have to put up to this. Every day I have to keep on going through this torture.

A world like this one, a world where everyone is constantly competing against each other, whether it is people competing for more likes on social media, or competing who has the higher grades or more income, or who has the better girlfriend and has the better sex, or has the happiest life, or who is more successful and able to beat his competition, or who is able to get the job he wants and the rest keep struggling and maybe even end up poor, a world where misery has become a means of humouring people like social media likes to poke fun of other people's flaws and failures, or the news likes to cause drama and panic when someone makes a mistake or something happens, no matter how big or small, or teachers and parents or people in charge, telling you what to be or not to be, how to dress, eat, drink and write, what to think or not to think, how you should be or not be. 

Plenty of people around, often looking for whatever faults and regrets and flaws you have, so that they could exploit it and take advantage of it and make you worse, 

Not to mention the internet, how much it is so full of trolls and cyber bullies who want to make you feel like you are the worst person on the planet, just because they can ....

 ... just the right kind of drug to give this bully, this abusive mind of mine that I was somehow chosen to have with me on a daily basis, the right kind of negativity and anxiety and torture to make me feel like I sold my soul to the devil and I deserve all that suffering.

That constant anxiety. That constant terror.

It is so much easier to just grab the rope and end it right there. 

Why would you choose to keep experiencing this day by day, night after night?

______________________________________________________________

Even right now, as I am typing this, I am reading and re-reading what I wrote, I am constantly shaking, I cannot think clearly and my mind is keeping a sharp eye on whatever spelling mistake or grammatical error or how much I sound like a person whose language are as poor as a mentally retarded person because his anxiety is so high everyday that he cannot think clearly at all, that mind is like a bully behind me, waiting to strike when I am at my most vulnerable. When I feel ashamed for a mistake that I made. When I am reminded about a past grade that I wished I could have done better. When I lost someone who cared about to someone else.

I often wish that I could grab a gun and shoot myself in the head. Maybe I will make that voice in my head shut up once and for all, but then again, it will still win anyway. Suicide is for cowards and pussies anyway ... and it calls me a coward and a pussy everyday.

If I keep breathing air in this damned planet, it will find a way to make me suffer and win anyway in the end. If I just end it, it will win either way.

"So, here is my deal. Im successful. I am in great shape. I have a good life.

However, i have 0 self worth. 0 Self esteem. The worst. It's been this way for years.

**Backstory**
Severely abused as kid.  Then when i got out, I would over react to situations like a psycho. Extreme over the top protective responses to minor things.  I never hurt anyone, hit anyone, but was a hot emotional mess with how i handled things.  Learned to manage that with years of therapy.

Additionally, I would often find myself in relationships with women, who were horribly abusive and did some pretty shit things, further hurting my self esteem that i would allow my self to be treated like that.


So, i guess i feel since that I have allowed people to treat me as if i had 0 self worth for so long, that i feel like new great people wont possibly feel different. 

Additionally, I have alot of anxiety that alot of people may think I am crazy/emotionally unstable if tot hear of some of my situations in the past and i have stopped interacting with new people simply out of this fear.


i guess my difficulty, is that if i was overweight, I would feel like atleast i could put a plan into place where i could logically lose the weight and help me feel better.

however, i have maxed out everything that i can improve that way(body, finances).  I have to change the way my mind works and honestly, it seems impossible.

"For a little while there, things were looking up. I was talking to lots of people at work and in my classes, I was (kind of) making friends. Nothing serious, but it was 10x better than where I was before. I thought that I was finally getting out of this seemingly endless depression that I was in (I've been dealing with it for years now). For the first time in a very long time I felt like I was getting better.

Ha. Right.

Here I am on New Year's, sitting in my room crying and feeling sorry for myself. Probably going to get drunk in a second. Nobody invited me to do anything or even included me in their mass-texted happy new years wishes. There was one person who I thought I was really hitting it off with who I was going to chill with for new years, but he's suddenly not really talking to me and ditched me tonight (*he* suggested hanging out) to go out and do something else (which he also didn't invite me to). I'm not mad at anybody for not inviting me, don't get me wrong I know I'm not entitled to an invite to anything. But shit...why am I even fucking trying? Apparently I'm not worth being friends with. I'm just the last resort when you're so bored at work or school that you'll talk to whoever's around. 

And it's not even like ""oh don't take it personally, everyone has 'work friends' separate from people they actually hang out with all he time."" But even that's not true. Everyone at my job is super close and they hang out all the time in big groups. I was the only one in my tiny department (besides the guys who work in the back and don't really interact with those of us up front) not to get invited to a coworker's wedding.

"Hello, I'm a 17 yo female high school senior.
So I have many problems, and I'm not going to point each of them out for the sake of keeping this post as short as possible.
I suffer from depression and loneliness and it's getting worse day by day.

Ever since I was in Kindergarten, I was always the odd one out. Honestly though, I don't think I'm at fault here.
Fast forward to middle school and high school, I was/am still alone all the time. Literally.

I'm always alone during recess and I haven't smiled genuinely in 2 years now. I do get happy sometimes but never smiled genuinely.
All the friendships I had just crashed and burned because me and the other person(s) never interacted much in real life or not interacted enough. 

Most of my ""strong"" friendships have been through messaging rather than real life reactions. I have never been in trouble or on an adventure with anyone when those stuff are exactly what makes the base of a real and strong friendship.

Not to mention that I have been made fun of a lot for my taste of music or the way I dress or why I never diet to lose a couple of pounds (seriously, I am fat but not obese.)

And because I went through a lot of difficulties during childhood and early adolescence and I had no one to advice me or be there for me, I've gotten really self conscious and insecure about almost everything. And I'll be honest here, I hate myself so much because of it and I have tried to commit suicide multiple times before.

Getting bullied, being underestimated and looked down upon by your classmates and teachers and also being left alone all the time does make one think ""why? Why am I the only one alone and why am I soooo hated and unwelcome everywhere? Am I such a bad person?"" And all those endless questions and the dark abyss of depression.

I have a strict dad who doesn't let me do most things others my age do and a mom who doesn't want me to defy my dad. Also, financially speaking, I don't come from a rich family like my classmates do but we have enough to live and afford a couple of luxuries.
I love my family so much but they have never understood my problems and struggles which is the main reason why I am the way I am right now. I'm pretty sure if we at least tried to understand each other, not just me but not one of my family members would suffer from a chronic depression and/or have thoughts of dying and committing suicide.
My family don't understand me, they love me but they don't understand me which is why I can't have a real deep conversation with any of them.

Recently, I have found quite a few good people as friends but because we all have our own priorities, we barely see each other and most of the time our interactions are through texts, and that way we won't have a strong and/or real friendship and I also think a lot about it because I honestly don't know what having friends is like... I don't want to be the only one who cares a lot about the others and would go to such extents for them but then after a while the whole friendship crashes and burns.
I want to tell them that I am here to stay but I also know that now is not the time because we have to have more real life interactions and know each other more.

Speaking of my other friendships... The friendships I considered to be real ended up with me being stabbed in the back and left alone with a broken heart.
And I found out that I had no real friends but everyone were just classmates when I considered them to be friends last year when I lost a very dear uncle whom I loved more than both my parents and considered myself to be his daughter, no one had my back then... No one told me to cheer up or at least kept me company until I was strong enough to overcome it.

Right now I am very exhausted of everything... I just want to relax a bit feeling respected and loved a little without worrying about who I am.

I just want to stop hating myself and start loving myself, build up my self esteem.

So tell me, great people of reddit, how do I stop hating myself, deal with loneliness and depression (preferably overcome both of them) and keep these new friendships I have made going without forcing any of those whom I deeply love and care about?

"I was sexually abused as a child, there I said it. I hate bringing it up, it's a mood killer and it's not hard to see why. The problem is, well, there are many problems. Let's just go through some of them: Extreme anxiety and depression, self doubt, little to no self confidence, the feeling that I am malingering when I am not (idk how to explain it), feeling constantly alone, forcing myself into positions where I am alone. You get the idea.

I also have terrible coping mechanisms, I mostly play video games to pass the time, I am smart as my mother constantly reminds me, but all I see are my failures. I only find happiness from other people, I am always angry and sad, and this paragraph is a mess and now I'm crying.

"When I was around 10 my mom was babysitting kids and we went outside to play. When we were playing we ended up using the hose and for some odd reason I told my friend to hold the hose so it wouldn't squirt water and I put my face over it and he let go and i angrily threw a plastic play toy at him ( a light toy ). My mom became instantly angry. She started saying come here in a angry voice and I ran across the yard. Surprisingly she didn't come get me. Long story short I ran in the house went under the couch and hid. My mom rang the phone to my dad and he answered my mom whose was screaming because she couldn't find me. She found me and grabbed me and I kept yelling ""god please help."" And she put her knees on my arm and grabbed a pillow and put it over my face. But then she let go and told me to go down stairs. She told me how much I was a mistake and how she hated me and doesn't love me.

I still remember that day like it was yesterday. I tried killing myself 3times this month because I think about it everyday. I don't know what to do because it emotionally scared me.

"I suspect that what I'm dealing with is a mixture of anxiety and depression, but I haven't been to talk to anyone yet. I'm a college student and plan to see one of the psychologists on-campus after they reopen for spring semester. Anyway, I've been dealing with a lot of issues of feeling alone, sad, and generally hating myself. Not all the time...but enough for it to be an issue. I only talk to my boyfriend because he's the only one I trust. I have one friend but we aren't close enough to discuss ""real"" issues. My anxiety stems from having a chronic illness and being sexually abused in a past relationship, on top of a lot of general social anxiety. A lot of my ""depression"" (I say that in quotes because I'm not sure if that's what it is yet) is self-defeating. I frequently find my mind telling me that I'm worthless, even though I logically know it isn't true. There have even been times when I'm home alone and force myself to go somewhere because 1)I'm too miserable in my own head and 2)I'm afraid I'll succomb to hurting (NOT killing) myself if I'm alone with my own thoughts. I've just been struggling a lot lately and wondered if anyone has similar experiences and has gotten through it. I am going to see someone, and I'm contemplating Zoloft. Not as a real fix, but just something to help me dig out of this hole I'm in right now. Sorry this was so long, just a lot of thoughts to shuffle through!

"Hi there. Sorry this is a bit long. I'm looking for some advice or words of wisdom on how to cope with a severely depressed and suicidal best friend.

We've been best friends since high school. We went to different colleges, but she ended up transferring to my school (huge state school) this year. It's been hard on her -- she hasn't made many friends. I hung out with her often and always invited her out with my friends, but I think she feels uncomfortable joining and my friends find her to be annoying. She's been struggling with depression and anxiety for as long as I've known her and has been consistently in therapy. She thought she was bipolar, but recently found out that she actually has borderline personality disorder and her parents/doctors have known for years. I think this makes her even more depressed.

This year she got really into xanax and was constantly barred out. I don't fuck with drugs for a lot of reasons and she is always pressuring me to try them, so I feel very uncomfortable around her when she's super messed up. One night she showed up at my dorm at 3am and passed out in the hallway after taking 7 bars and mixing it with alcohol. I took her to the emergency room and she stayed at the hospital for several days in the psychiatric ward. She doesn't get along with her family and refused to let her parents visit her or make any medical decisions. During this time, I was the only person she would contact so I brought her everything she needed, visited multiple times daily, helped her get excuses for all her classes, etc. 

After this incident she promised she was done with xanax. I know now that she continued to abuse it almost daily, but was more secretive about it. She went out and partied every weekend, acting like everything was fine. She got fired from her job (we work together) and failed all her exams. She found out that she's pregnant and doesn't know who the father is, and asked me to come with her to get an abortion. She told me she was going to take the next semester off and try to figure things out. She blamed me for encouraging her to transfer and not being there for her. In hindsight, I know I could have done more to help her adjust to the new school, but she repeatedly told me she didn't like my friends and wanted to make her own. 

She hooked up with my ex boyfriend when she was blacked out. I forgave her because I know she doesn't remember it and wouldn't have done it sober, but it still upsets me when I think about it.

Two days ago she tried to kill herself. She drank half a bottle of vodka and took 20+ different types of pills. She sent me a suicide note via text in which  she wanted me to send paragraphs she'd written to multiple different people. There was a note for me at the end-- she said that I ""was never there for her"" and that she feels sorry for me because I'm more ""fucked up"" than she is and I don't even realize it. 

I called her immediately, got her to send me her location, and then called 9-1-1 and her parents. When the ambulance got there, she was foaming at the mouth and they said she would have died within 20-30 minutes. Her mom has been keeping me updated the past two days. She woke up today and luckily doesn't have any brain damage. She's been asking to talk to me but doesn't have access to her phone and doctors won't let her speak or visit with any non-family members.

I just don't know what to do. The past six months have been hell for her, but also for me. She hasn't been there as a friend at all, which is completely understandable given the situation, but I've found myself becoming more distant from her. She tells me that I'm the best friend she's ever had, and then the next day says everyone else is telling her to not be my friend because I'm such a shitty person? I feel like I'm becoming depressed myself now. My therapist told me that the friendship is toxic. Everyone thinks I'm crazy for sticking by her. But all  her other friends have abandoned her. I see how much pain she's in, and I know she would do the same for me. At the same time I don't think I can keep this up much longer. I'm still her best friend, but she's no longer mine.

It makes me so sad to think about all of the good memories we have together. Would a true friend stand by her through this, even though she doesn't seem to want me to? I don't ever want to be in this situation again where her life is in my hands.

"I have been trying for a long time. I dont know if I can ever get over the things that have happened to me in my life or if I can ever be happy. I have a daughter so I dont want to do anything that will make it harder for her. But I dont know what else to do. I dont know if Im codependent on this misery or what. I know every day I wake up its going to be more of the same. I hate feeling this way. I want to be happy and alive and 'me' again. But so much has happened and Im going to be 43 this month. Why should I keep trying to find solutions? By the time I fix what needs fixing...even if I can, Ill be to old to enjoy any of it. Im tired of living a life of pain and suffering. I mask it with smoking weed or meds. It seems like I just lose more as I go on. Friends pass away from disease or suicide, family members pass on. I am struggling with wether or not to end my life. I wonder if I should look for easy ways to do it. I keep thinking about it but the ways I envision all seem like horrible ways to go out and Ive been through enough pain. Why should I try to hang on again? I wish that I mattered. Or that I was important enough for someone to care. After 20 years of ptsd and the anxiety and depression Im in a place where Im unable to work or provide for myself. I dont know if I do or dont want disability or if I can even get it. I grew up cutting down trees, building houses and raising horses and what not. My pride is something that comes up over and over. Ive been out of work for over 5 years. Ive been kept isolated for most of that and its one thing to have therapy and medicine. But Im still stuck here dependent on someone who has abused me. But maybe I should give them more time. I know Im not perfect. I have my own issues. Maybe Im just screwing everything up with this line of thinking. But I do know that I am co dependent. After all the abuse and nightmares and the pain, I dont know if I will ever be able to live the life I want to. Why would I choose to stay like this? I dont want to keep going like this. This isnt how its supposed to be. Life and the world around us really does fascinate me and I always wanted to find a place in it. But after all this time of being cut off from it I cant keep coming up with reasons to just keep hurting. I dont want to have to keep coming back and doing things like this as a last ditch effort.  I used to be so resilient and able to bounce back, nowadays im just so worn out and tired and drained.  Life keeps dangling a carrot in front of my face.  And like a fool I try to chase it, just to to find more pain.  Im tired of trying.  Im tired of feeling like Im damned.  I dont want to get on here and make a post like this for attention.  I just DONT want to feel like this anymore.  And its getting worse and harder to deal with.  If there was a button I could push that would end it painlessly I wonder if i would press it.  When its like this I wonder why in the hell I wouldnt press it.  There were things I wanted to do with my life.  Things I was sure that I was here to do.  And now it seems my whole lifes purpose was just to suffer.  I still feel like that little boy who was beaten bloody as a kid and taught to live in fear.  Why is it that he cant get justice?  Life was suppose to be somuch fuller and more beautiful.  But for me, my mind is under attack more often than not.  I have been doing all I can for years now, Id be lying if I said some things havent gotten better.  But at this rate Ill never get there in time.  And Ive been doing it on my own with little to no help while other people are working against me.  When will it get better?  When do the good things start happening?

"26, the only son of a proud Asian family, gay since birth. Coming out is never an option at it would DESTROY my parents, and I love them so bad. 
The main problem, I'm struggling with overcoming this ""love"" with my straight friend (For almost 3 years now, he just got married last year). As I learnt how to fake my feeling since I was a kid, I did it so well even now he still has no idea about (At least it's what I think). In the last two years I've been trying to keep the distance but still no use, the feeling just keeps getting stronger.  Ironically enough, all my life I've met so many people, but only have feeling for that only guy. Yep, the first ever, and only one til this day. Like a fucking joke, sounds romantic (if we remove the gender details) but so fucked up at the same time (as it actually is). Even worse, he sure loves me (like bro to bro). I did so many mean stuffs to keep the distance, things like replying K, being aggressive, ignoring his birthday, his new year message etc. very very mean, but the guy seems to be too patient with me, looks like he clearly wants us back to be best bro as we did before. Forgot to mention, we were co-worker for more than a year, then life happens, he moved abroad (This was when I decided to stop being nice to him - with hope of finding an escape for myself but failed :/), and later on, got married. That means there's been a real geographical distance between us as well - even that wouldn't do any good to my feeling.
It's such a shame to admit this but you guys can't imagine how many night I've lost sleep, crying all the tears I got, praying that god or any higher power up there, please erase me from this life, then the next day everyone would forget my existence and just move on. I want to die, but don't want to kill my parents selfishly. I'm tired of being alone, but then I can only fake my feeling to an extent, showing affection to a girl - that's too much for me. Would also do me no good for sure, I'm hungry for true happiness, something that can't be faked.
I still go to work everyday, fake my laughter. I have a job that pays well, you can say I'm financial independent. But none of this matters soon, being the only son I MUST keep the family's bloodline going. But well, with this mess inside my head, I don't know what to do now. I've been thinking about confessing it all to him, maybe that will actually freak him out and I can finally move on? But, damn, so many but, the idea of actually losing him from my life forever scares the shit out of me. After all I'm this loser who can have his whole week brightened just by receiving a text ""hey"" from a bro I'm secretly in love, even though I'll just pretend to ignore it or reply with K. It's that pathetic.",1," Asian , Gay, cannot come out, love guy friend, he moved abroad, got married, only person ever loved"
"I'm fairly young, junior in high school , but I do not wish to disclose my age. My mom is a hardcore muslim, forcing her religion on me and all my sisters. My sisters are much older than I am...one is addicted to adderall, and two are depressed. I developed a drug and alcohol problem  in sophomore year of high school which escalated very quickly. I even almost overdosed off of a combination of xanax and alcohol.

I used all these drugs and alcohol just because they were fun, not because I was depressed or sad or anything. My alcohol problem climaxed when I almost fought a police officer at a party when I was drunk. This led my mom to making me see a psychologist, and I genuinely felt bad for my substance abuse so I left drinking all at once.

During the summer I became addicted to Xanax because I was terrified of my dad catching me drinking, that I just resorted to Xanax, as it is a cheap drunk. When school started in September, I had minor xanax withdrawal and I felt terrible. I started to drink moderately again.

Just some more background... I feel like my dad genuinely dislikes me, and just tries to hide it up with fake conversations. All my sisters tell me my dad is a psycho when it comes to me. My dad always tries to turn my mom against me, calling me a manipulator and all types of shit. We have a shitty relationship as we aren't even close. My alcohol problem is misleading as I still get good grades in school, and I have very good studying habits. I strive so hard in school because I want to leave my shitty life behind

My life started to spiral out of control fast, and I became depressed, anxious, and restless. I partied every weekend and drank a lot, but my parents wouldn't catch me as I am good at acting sober. I started drinking on weekdays, and I started to feel so lonely. 

I finally met a girl, and not to sound corny, but I genuinely fell in love. She likes me a lot, and she actually makes me happy. For some reason she makes me anxious and restless too, so I started to have a harder drinking problem. I do not know why she gets me so restless, but I do know that it's really fucking us up. Because of my mood swings I always begin to flirt with her, getting her hopes up, and then I suddenly crash and I turn her down. I know I'm hurting her a lot, but I have so much shit going on in my life that it distracts me. I think I don't want to get too close to her for a fear of being left and hurt.

My life became hectic when my mom found beers in my room, and my parents realized my alcohol problem was still present. I know my mom genuinely cares, but her shoving religion in my throat gets me angrier, as I can't have a normal relationship with her because she only talks about school and religion. I know my dad on the other hand does not care about my drinking habit, but just that he wants to shit on me.

We had a family party I had to attend to, and I know this was a poor decision, but me and my family friend drank a little bit. I got breathalyzed by my dad when I came home, and I blew a .04. My dad promised he wouldn't tell my mom if I stopped drinking, and I made a deal. When my mom heard from someone that I was drinking, my dad quickly turned on me and texted my mom discretely about our deal. I confronted my dad and he blatantly lied to my face about it, even deleting the messages off his phone and showing it to me, acting like he never texted my mom. My mom gave up on me and said I was garbage with an alcohol problem, and it actually hurt me deeply

I started drinking even harder as I felt my parents stopped caring for me, and my dad caught me with alcohol again, and they told me to leave the house. I was packing my bags, and my mom gave me a bunch of garbage bags. I was about to leave the house when my mom told me that if I left, I would never be allowed back in. I stayed home, and my mom said I was a disgrace and all that shit. I didn't care what she had to say, but she said I might have to go to rehab

I know I have a drinking problem and a lot of psychological problems, but I think it's best I leave the house for a month. I have many friends houses to stay at, and I have enough money to live away from home for a month. I genuinely want to find peace in my life again, and I am in such a shit hole right now that it hurts to think about. I told my sister about leaving the house, and she never dismissed it, as she was kicked out the house for a month too. Is this the right way to find peace in my life again?

"Okay so this is the story of how I had everything a 19 year could possibly want and how I lost it just as fast. I had everything. I had a loyal gf, I had a good paying job, a car, had lots of friends who I considered ""brothers"", I had a good relationship with my mom and sisters, I was going out every weekend having fun. Everything was perfect. I had never been so happy in my life. I was saving up for a newer car, for college, I was planning lots of great things for myself. I thought maybe I had finally gotten into the right track. I started hanging out with the wrong people though. I knew it was wrong but I didn't think I would ever get caught. We would go out at night and go through people's cars , steal whatever was valuable, credit cards, wallets, purses, electronics, guns, whatever we thought we could get money for. I was going on $1000 shopping sprees. One night I went out by myself and got caught. I was arrested, put in jail for 3 days and then I bonded out. My bond was $13,500 for 5 counts of felony entering auto, and 1 count of prowling. That's when my life flipped upside down. I know i put myself in that situation. I don't blame anyone else. Suddenly I had nothing. My friends I considered ""brothers"" didn't ever call to check up, they weren't even worried. So I had no friends now. No car. No money. (I hired a decent lawyer but she charged $4000). I lost my job in which I had just gotten a raise . I got a new one but it's a job I hate for less the money I was making back then. All my money goes to my lawyer, rent, and bills. I haven't bought myself anything in over 4 months. I'm not a citizen of the United States so if my lawyer can't drop find a way to drop the charges then I'm going to get deported back to Colombia where I was born. I haven't been there in 15 years since I was 4. So now I had the stress of not even knowing if I was going to be able to stay in the country with my mom and 4 sisters. If I was going to be able to stay with my girlfriend. I had no way of seeing her because I didn't have a car, no money to take her out, no friends to go out with. So I started pushing her away, avoiding texts, avoiding calls, avoiding chances to meet up. I knew how much she loved me, she was head over heels, I've never seen someone love me so much. But I didn't want her to fall more and then me get deported. That would have crushed her. So I continued pushing her away, every argument I would suggest breaking up. So one day I just did it , I broke up with her. Blocked her on all social media. I miss her tho but she is already talking to someone else. Now that I'm trying to meet new people I can't seem to be genuinely interested in. What they tell me about them and about their lives. I want to care. But I just don't. I want to be social, and active and positive and all these good things but I just can't. It's always in the back of my head. A little voice telling me, what's the point of getting to know them, what's the point of texting them back ? You're going to get deported in a couple months anyways. I talk to a girl for 1-2 days and then I stop talking to them all together . I don't even find joy in things that I used to love, like soccer , I tell myself what's the point in going. To go play if you're gonna get deported in a couple months. I want to be able to live productively , positively, I want to just live but this court case is holding me back. The thought of this impending doom in holding me back and I'm letting life pass in front of me. Idk what to do.

"Hi everyone, I should've done a throw away account. 

I found this subreddit recently and I'm not sure where to start exactly. Not sure if this is even the right place. I just have this feeling of general loss, I'm 22 turning 23 in June. I live at home with my dad, I have no idea where my mom is, and that's fine. My parents went through a 8+ year divorce and I think it messed me up. I was 8 at the time, my mother was incredibly abusive to us. I still remember her choking my sister over the bathroom tub. It's something I don't think I'll ever forget. I spent those 8 years constantly moving from house to house apartment to apartment. I finally just stopped unpacking my things 

I was always described as the happy kid. Of course I was happy, I was fat as fuck. I had to smile or I probably would've killed myself in middle school, I certainly told myself enough times I was going to. Kids are fucking ruthless. I think it's fair to say I cried a lot up until high school. I lost that weight in high school, busted my ass and made something of myself. But now all I ever hear is how I'm not happy and that everyone misses the dacotah that was happy. I think they really just miss the dacotah that they could pick on without repercussions. I'm not sure how to feel about it all, if I'm not expressing a feeling of loss I just feel numb.

 I have problems expressing myself, or so I'm told. My college roommates used to call me emotionally detached. My girlfriend at the time thought so too, eventually they all just pushed me out of their life. I spent the 2nd half of the year alone in my dorm. 

I've never had the heart to call somebody out on their shit or get mad at somebody. I just end up mad at myself and wishing for that brief moment of misery to be over. My girlfriend, god bless her, has been supportive through these last couple months but she doesn't fully get it, and I don't know if I could ever explain it all. I love her to death and I hate the look on her face when I'm upset, nobody should ever have to worry about me.

In the 5 or 6 years since my sister ran away I have done nothing but watch my father fall into a pit of alcoholism. He's pushed everyone away from him and his problems only get thrown or deflected on me. He blames me for all of his misery, the divorce, the money. Which of course only opens opportunities for me to get confronted further. He would bitch me out and threaten to kick my ass, he'd pass out and I'd pick him up.  He'll apologize the next morning say he didn't mean it and do it again the next week. He actually did this again recently, he apologized but I've never wanted to be further from him. I'm not sure if he even remembers what all he has said. I haven't had the heart to tell him all the disgusting things he's said to me but it's really killing me knowing how he really feels. 

I know how to play instruments and I don't consider myself an idiot, I'm sure I have some smarts. I was always a busy person, writing for blogs, testing supplements for muscle tech, playing shows or just general choir engagements. I work for a cleaner service currently and I'm miserable. I thought working with things instead of people would help me. Instead I spend my time sweating my ass off while my 50 something coworker just supervises and judges everything I do.

I grew up in a family w mental illness and some abuse, not super close to parents or siblings, or friends really... I have enough friends but... God I just feel like... so fuckin alone now. 
          
I need connection and intamacy but I have become cold and untrusting... and there's a part of me that has hope and is positive and strong - and I'm a good man, but I struggle with addiction to niccotine weed and alcohol... and depression...

Know that it's okay to let someone love you, and to love them. Love just for the sake of sharing kindness with someone. Be kind to yourself. It isn't easy for anyone to be human and this world should have more love in it.

"The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping.

Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). 

My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance.

So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state. Typing this all out kind of helped in a weird way. 

Thank you for listening, I hope it makes more sense than I think it does.",1,"dealing with couple of sexual assaults, sleeping a lot smoking weed, trying ,failing, succeding at coping, therapist onvacation"
"Over the last year I have felt like my life was just getting worse and worse. I left my fiance in November of 2015, which is a long story but it boils down to I always felt like I was never enough in her eyes. I felt like she was emotionally abusive, so I left. For a time I seemed to be happy. I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",1,"left fiance , she was emotionally abusive, moved back to home town, living with sister, shell of my forme self due to ex."
"I'm am a 15 year old male who has depression. I been bullied throughout my life, ignored, look down upon, and even laughed at for being stupid. Depression has taken a lot on me and I can't deal with it anymore. People I try to talk to at school just ignore me or talk to my so called friends around me who also ignored me, and it just makes me filled with rage, sadness, and envy. I helped those people in the past and they don't repay me back. I sit alone at lunch, and basically just a loner in general. My family doesn't know I have depression and I don't want to tell them because it will make them sad and I love them.I will probably  kill myself later this year, or during the school year and see how much they care.( Probly won't), but hey, at least I'm passing my classing with a, and b's. All I'm asking for is friendship or just to be happy, or at least an aquatience. I have to go to school in a little but I haven't gone to sleep. Well fuck me, I guest I'm just a boring, ugly, stupid person. Probably  will just stay in sick I guess.

"The more I sit back and think. The more I realize that I'll never recover from the psychological damage both high school and college have caused me.

People were just downright awful to me in high school. I was physically, emotionally, and mentally abused by shit heads that live in my neighborhood. It's like there mission was to make my life miserable. They ruined my life in every way. They posted humiliating pictures of me online. They beat me up whenever they feel like it. They called me horrible names. You name it they did it. 

My senior year prom date was a complete bitch. She didn't talk to me for the entire night and abandoned me for her friends. Literally everything was perfect we talked every day, I asked her to prom. Then it all went downhill. She never acknowledged me presence in school. She was so rude to me on prom night. I regret following her around like I was some stupid sheep. Should have just left her. I recently snapped and got really mad at her when we didn't talk for awhile. I let her have it and I feel no remorse that I lashed out on her. She deserved it with the hell she put me through. She broke my heart and ruined my prom night. Something I'll never get back.

I had no friends in high school. People would just ignore me. Never asked me for plans. They were all just fake ass people. They always talked to people that were better then me. I was always a second choice. Not even a fucking second choice. 

High school set the stages and fucking destroyed any positive view I have on people. I often stormed out of classes and broke down crying in the guidance office because of how I was treated. Nobody gave a shit. I was sent home one day after having a complete meltdown, throwing a tissue box at my counselor, crying, and getting so mad to the point I almost passed out. I literally hate people. All I have done was be friendly to them and they have to treat me like shit in return. People did some nasty things to me and I was suicidal. Now I come out of high school with an extremely hateful view on people my age. I wanted friends and I still want friends, but literally me getting friends is just super unlikely. So I just sit back and watch the others have fun while I rot.

College? Heh, people told me college would be different. My parents made me go to my local community college and that decision fucked over any chance of me having a normal college social life. I'm mad at my parents to this day for not letting me go to a college I wanted to go to. Now I'll never get to experience the joys of living in a dorm and I don't have any friends for an apartment. I hate college. Nobody at my college talks to each other. It's antisocial and I'm often sitting alone or walking alone. Nobody talks to me. I even approach people in class, nobody talks to me.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm extremely shy. Yes, I've gotten better at it but honestly, this doesn't make a difference because I even talked to people and they still wouldn't act like I'm there.

I also am not much of a partier. I hate parties and I just hate being around drugs and alcohol. It just isn't my kind of fun and I always stay away from it.

Literally laying here in my bed crying which I have been for the last fucking week. I don't have a therapist appointment till Friday. My therapist is too busy to talk too. I honestly don't think I'll make it to Friday. I am becoming suicidal again and I just don't see a point in living through these awful college + high school years. Even if I make it, I'm so psychologically fucked up from high school and college that it will impact me in the future. I don't want to live anymore. I just want to be happy again and sadly I think ending it is the only way as I can't get anything going for me.",1,"never recover from psychological damage from school and college,abused physically, emotionally and mentally in neighbourhood, senior year porn date abandoned me , rude on prom night, no friends in high school"
"Hello!
This is my first post on Reddit. English is not my native tongue so bare with me.

My mom and dad molested me from 0-18 years old. My dad got me pregnant at the age of 11. We went abroad and I had an abortion. When I was younger (before I hit puberty) they sold me to other men and allowed them to use me as they pleased for a night, sometimes a whole weekend. 

At 18 I got a good job and moved far away from them. Now I'm 23 and my life is very good. I married the man of my dreams and together we have a 1 year old kid. I know I should be happy but I always feel depressed and anxious. I have flashbacks everyday and nightmares every night. 

I'm starting a ptsd program with a therapist tomorrow and to be honest I don't want to go - I'm really scared. I don't know what will happen when I start talking about everything that happened when I was a kid.
I feel like my childhood was just too messed up and I will never get over it. I'm so tired of the flashbacks and the nightmares. I have too many bad memories. I don't want to live like this, I can't live like this. 

Do you think I can get over this and be normal?

"I posted on suicide a couple of minutes ago. I really dont know i am gonna kill myself but surely not today, theres an overwhelming feeling of numbness inside me and i feel like i am nothing really.
I take medication for depression over 16 years now. Five years ago i started taking meds also for anxiety. I have an eating disorder for also nearly 16 years. I feel low and like if i was completely worthless.
I have conquered many battles in my life, sexual abuse by relative and school peers, drug addiction and acute self harming. Ive had awful relationships where i guess i was trying to fill the emotional void my father left inside my soul. The father of my child was abusive and an alcoholic and a drug addict. He got over his issues and is really a changed man and we get along fine. I still feel bad for not making us work or succeed. Like many things in my life, it was a huge failure. Ive tried practically everything to feel better, excersise, therapy, talking with friends etc, but now i have hit a low point in my life and i dont know really if i can recover.
I started a new relationship almost a year ago, i am in love with this man and i suffer every day. He is perfect, professional and amazing. He is bit older than me. He is cold and hot with me every month and shuts me down every now and then. Ive done everything to make it work but he has left me again and now for good. I cant believe its over. I gave my heart and soul to this relationship and now its done. I loved him and gave him everything he needed. Now he hates me and has blocked me from everything while i beg for him to come back. One week ago he told me he loved me and gave me a beautiful ring, now im devastated and alone.
I take care of my mother and child. I have a decent job and no financial worries atm.
I feel like the worst mother on earth, like scum and i really want to die at moments and have attempted numerous times. 
I feel lost and that everyone would be better off without me. I look at the subway rails and think if i will have the courage, i cut from time to time and beg to have the courage to press down hugely on to the blade, stand infront of avenues and think of jumping infront of a bus...
I feel like giving up and that everything i have tried and fought for has been worthless, like me, cos in reality im just a piece of shit.
I really dont know what to do...

"This is going to long guys..sorry. I've been a long time lurker and I've never posted. I've read all of your posts, shared tears and smiles with things that I identify with. It makes me feel both sad and happy to know I'm not alone. I've been depressed since I could remember. I used to be a happy and positive little girl until the first time I was bullied. Since, I've been bullied and made to feel like shit from so many people in my life. My low self-esteem began maybe when I was 6? I've been struggling with life since. I'm 25 and I haven't finished my degree. Why? Because I can't make myself do the work. I get motivated for the first month and say this year will be different and I fucking fall into depression again and I can't get out. I fear falling behind and when I do I fucking give up. I will get my degree this spring (finally). I've had to get academic withdrawals because of my depression. I feel like a failure while all the people I know are flourishing. My life needs to change.

I told my mom today that I want to make an appointment with a psychiatrist so I can get meds. I've depressed my entire life...and I've tried to deal with it but my life is shit and I know something needs to change. I called and made an appointment and I'm fucking scared. I don't want to talk to someone who will be internally judging my fucked up decisions and life. 

Then my mom has been acting bummed and I asked why. She said she doesn't understand. Her and my dad have given me all they could and it doesn't make sense why I'm sad. She's now sad and blaming herself. I've tried to tell them it's not their fault and they don't get it. I can't talk to them. 

I can't talk to my boyfriend. We've been together for seven years. We met in college and I was better with my depression and actually socialized. But the years carried on and he graduated and we've been long distance since. I lost my friends because they betrayed me or just found me so boring. My best friend stopped talking to me when I got a senator internship over her congressman one. She just stared at me when I told her and neither she or her family congratulated me. She stopped talking to me since then. That was three years ago. She was my last friend. Sine then, I don't hang out with anyone, except my boyfriend when he visits. We've been long distance for the last five years but after my best friend left me, I've been so alone. 

My boyfriend is the opposite of me. In college and after, he's that guy everyone loves. He can make friends with a freaking tree. He attracts people and he has many friends and is social. I'm the complete opposite. He has to beg to get me to come out with him and his friends, and if I do i always have to drink. It's the only way I can talk and not just sit their silent. He's seen me when I'm so depressed that I can't even get out of bed. The last year has been horrible for me. I've spent weeks just in bed... and I can tell he's getting tired of it. 

He keeps saying I bring up the past and the pain I've endured and I can't let things go. I want to I just don't know how. I don't trust people and I don't know how to carry on conversations anymore. I feel resentful he's so social and well liked. When I'm alone watching TV like any other fucking day, he's out and having fun. I want to but I can't. 

For New Years Eve, I saw he was with people (mostly girls) and I texted him saying ""are you spending new years with girls??"" He just said. ""not one, there are some here but I'm not with them."" I told him to ""well have fun."" He didn't call to say HNY or hasn't talked to me since. 

The past four days I had another depressive ""bender."" I just cried, slept, and stared at my ceiling. I couldn't even watch tv. I just go some motivation to do some shit. 

I'm hoping seeing the psychiatrist will help and I can get ADD and Anti-Depressants. Shit needs to change. 

I've just been writing down my thoughts. Sorrry this is so long. This is just 10% of what I wish I could say but I don't want to write a freaking 100 page essay.

"I was starting to feel low and burn out before New Years, and the evening allowed me to rise above my subjective perspective of myself and my interactions with people. I usually try not to party too hard *nudge nudge*, but it was a net positive I think. I reevaluated how I was doing and got a more complete view of psychological state.

I was also really happy to feel comfortable and actually see (as opposed to view a person through my preconceived notion) people a little more than I usually am able to.

Gender and Sexuality
===============
I grew up in a conservative environment, but I actually never felt ashamed of my gender or ashamed of my sexuality. I would get boy and girl crushes all the time and think nothing of it other than, ' oh this person is so cool and I really want to get to know them'. I was more effeminate and got bullied for it, including authority figures turning a blind eye or encouraging it. Pretty lame times that reinforced that people can be savage.

In expression and identity, I guess I was pretty androgynous growing. I never felt like I was a woman or that I wanted to be a manly man. I thought the gender binary people expressed themselves in was narrow and boring, so I kind of made a point to disregard it. 

Unfortunately, I have also learned that some people will not let you survive or function without expressing yourself in a way that they seem fit. I've experienced way too many people being openly hostile because of my mere existence. Today, I have to role-play as a bro just to survive in many professional environments. It feels degrading to my soul, but the trade off is I have some money. Its a bit emotionally exhausting and doesn't feel nice.

All in all, I am bi and not too happy with the prejudices people have in the world.


Socialization
==============
I am used to compartmentalizing my feelings. I have lost a great deal of friends who had either fallen off the face of the earth, OD'd, killed themselves, or had been too much grief to keep in contact with. I am craving close relationships and self-growth, but I am finding it difficult to meaningfully connect with people. I wonder if the feeling of abandoning other people because it is easier than being abandoned comes into play for me right now. I've felt that way in the past, but I thought I got over it. 

I am going to school and have had gainful employment, but it doesn't help me connect in the ways I seek. I socialize and feel like I am role-playing. Many friendships with people seem superficial and unfulfilling, and these are typically with normalish people. I don't have a problem putting myself 'out there' if I'm not down and out in a low period. I am social and have been told I am easy going and funny just as often as I've been told I can come across as a bitch without intending to or even saying anything (hah).

Despite what other people seem to think, I usually feel on-guard and can hardly be intimate / open up to folks. I think my memory is eroding due to long-term stress. What good is living life and collecting lessons from experiences if you can't remember them? What good is gaining perspective if you just lose it in a time of need? 

I'm uneasy not knowing people's motivations. I try to learn about people and what they want from me in an attempt to predict what may happen. 


Relationships
===============
I don't feel like I need to be in a relationship, but I do know that I need meaningful relationships. Although, it would be nice to find someone romantically that sees me for who I am and empowers me. Obviously, I have my doubts that I'll let anyone close enough to get the chance though.

Current partner was raised by a narcissist and is emotionally unavailable in a similar way as me. It is a comfortable yet emotionally unfulfilling relationship. I guess we're together out of a mutual need for physical intimacy and care? We care for each other, and she's incredibly gifted and into really cool stuff. We both value our space apart too due to similar issues.


The abridged version of my life:
================
As a child, I was very depressed due to life circumstances out of my control. Many of the relatives that I was close to straight up died, moved away, or quit speaking to me due to my parents' issues.

My parents made very unwise mistakes, fought often, and were not emotionally empowering. Purposefully went out of my way to not pick up their habits. Kind of felt a low-level mistrust of people since childhood due to bullying from other kids and abuse from authority figures. I liked books way more than people and read a lot. Most of my role-models were dead white guys haha.

High school was better, smoked weed and did somewhat engaging things with friends. Urban exploring, clubbing, extracurriculars, art, etc.

In spite of my world sucking, I was pretty motivated to leave and made decent grades. I qualified for a bunch of academic scholarships and went overseas. Found out the home was being foreclosed and the cars repossessed about midway through my year abroad. Traveled as much as I could and tried to not think too hard about returning to a state of no opportunities. Kinda spiraled into depression after realizing how good I was living abroad and how I would likely not see my new friends again.

At 16 I was thrust out into the world alone, ended up with little to no social supports or family due to my sexuality. It was also easier for my parents since they were struggling to get back on their own feet. Went around with a traveler friend I had made, riding trains and getting into trouble. Watched my travel buddy die of a heroin OD. Wound up in an abusive relationship on the coast. Pimped by someone older than me that I had been dating, experienced extreme stress and trauma due to some pretty bad influences in my life and feeling like there was no way out.

Eventually distanced myself from most of these horrible people, but I went through a period of agoraphobia where I wouldn't leave my apartment even if I ran out of food. Routinely disassociated and felt unable to connect to people.

Went on anti-psychotics for treatment resistant depression, basically strung out of my mind on benzos most of the day. Ditched the psych-meds and started meditating, doing shrooms, gradually meeting people. Got somewhat better, but I lost memories and cognitive functioning as a side effect of the anti-psychotics and benzos. Eventually returned to baseline (I think). Enrolled at a nearby school.

Started dating a guy who was diagnosed with NPD and in the marine corps. At first, his confidence and arrogance was endearing, and he was on frequent deployments which meant that we really valued the time we had together. Felt like I had a home for the first time in my life and actually loved. He was emotionally withdrawn, and I was also emotionally messed up to an extent. It worked out well enough. Was making a decent amount of money doing online stock trading and investing as well as taking classes online.

We would talk about our perspectives of the world. Goals. Ways to achieve our dreams. I designed our apartment and basically took care of his cats. Although I paid half the rent, I was kind of like expected to be a live-in nanny which wasn't too weird considering the shit I had gone through in life so far. He was a dom and we were both poly, so he would date basically my female-equivalent clones and we'd have threesomes (I would usually have shortish platinum blond haircuts and so would they). FWIW the sex with him pretty great even though he was kind of a sociopath.

After his contract with the military ended and he felt somewhat aimless, he began to cycle through emotions quickly and decided I wasn't worth his time. Literally a week after professing an extreme amount of love for me that he never felt before. He once described loving people like he would love eating a candy bar. That I had never done anything good for him. Really felt mind fucked - this wasn't a naive first relationship sorta deal. I even went with him to meet his parents once. It seriously felt like a deep relationship up until that point. 

Moved with friends to the bay, so did he. After a 6 month period of lackluster dating, we began an on and off again fuck-buddy relationship with that same guy. We agreed it would be purely physical, but he was trying to cross my boundaries. Eventually, I asked him to stay out of my life entirely. He told he had raped me after I passed out from GHB one evening bwfore either of us moved to the bay. I remember the incident vaguely, but I never opened my eyes and so just left it up to being something I imagined. Really screwed with me.

Best friend at the time was dating my partner, they ended up doing meth and being dicks. I cut them out of my life after they stoles from me. Not so funnily enough, my current best friend is being weird with my current partner - has been rejected by her and feels dissatisfied in his dating life. I feel like there is resentment being directed at me  and things are compounding on top of it. Too emotionally stressed to deal with it, so I am giving him space for awhile.

Had a crazy housemate situation where a couple made living at my space unbearable for me and 3 other housemates. We were all on the lease and couldn't evict them. I was stressed 100% of the time and never knew what they would do next. Can't really relax there even though they've been gone.

I am ashamed of what I have been through, but I try not to blame myself entirely for my life circumstances. A life without self-expression and enjoyment isn't a life worth living. I am sick of only surviving. I know something is wrong, but I don't have the tools to identify and fix it.

I've seen 6 different therapists - all ended up being useless, clueless, or offensive. Struggling to find a quality low income psych or therapists, but I am asking around.


*My living situation is tenuous and there is no long-term guarantee of housing. I also live in an extremely expensive area, and I don't have any social supports outside of here. Kind of feel trapped by this. 


Current thoughts
==============
I don't want to live a fear based lifestyle. 

I'd like to think that with all of my life experiences and trauma, I am not a complete basket case. I think I work much harder than most people to hold myself together. My worst fear is that I will become an emotionally reactive monster and permanently lose sight of the humanity of others. That my ability to rationalize and integrate my experiences will be lost forever. That I will be a scared, closed off, zombie for the rest of my life. It's really unnerving.

I've made so much progress over the last 5ish years to reach a point of relative stability, but it doesn't seem to be enough. I can't continue to expend so much energy on getting by. It's chipping at my will to live. With that being said, I'm not planning to make rash decisions. 


Some problems I have
==============
*Moody

*Typically pretty tense

*Tend to feel a level of stress at all times

*burn out after period of high stress leading to being withdrawn / unmotivated

*Have to fake being relaxed to interact with people in high stress periods (lots of projects, midterms/finals, relationship stuff)

*Memory is worsening

*Sometimes memories are hard to put in chronological order, not impossible - but it takes actual effort to piece together

*Sleep not restful

*Expect the worse from people, but I try to give them opportunities to prove me wrong 

*Sometimes impulsive when depressed, but I work pretty hard to control this - used to be caught up by by life's wayward distractions instead of introspecting 

*Sometimes experience anhedonia

*ADHD may be related

*Funnily enough, I don't feel safe being emotional around people sometimes",1,"grew up in conservative environment, bullied for being effiminate, mocked for androgynous growing, parents figth, no friends, current partner emotionally unavailable"
"So my mum was 17 and moved out of her parents house, she got married to the first guy she met. He went to prison 2 months later and she had nowhere to go except back home. Her parents told her she couldn't come back unless she got divorced and so she did. Then a friend of hers tells her they know someone who has a house that is empty and has power. So she decides to go squat there. Well apparently the guy who was staying there was in jail. he gets out and they start living together. They have sex and she gets pregnant with me. Around the same time she's seeing the type of person he really is. She's pregnant and he wants to get pitbulls and he is training them to be fighting dogs. He takes her cat and feeds it to the dogs to rile them up. He beats her a lot. He kills her pets. One day the dog poop on the floor and he beats her with the shower rod and makes her eat the dog poop. Luckily she doesn't loose me as she is about 7 months pregnant. One of his friends comes over and helps her leave and my father accuses her of cheating. She wasn't cheating, even though Casey was in love with her and thats why he helped her. Im about 10 months old and she steals a dog from a man who was abusing it. She goes to jail for like 2 days. When she gets home, my father hadn't even as so much as changed my diaper. He was passed out drunk. Fast forward to when I am 3. She finally leaves him after he points a crossbow at me. After that she gets married and my step dad is strict but im also spoiled. We had money and a farm and my mum is the perfect mum and houseswife. When I am 10 she has an affair with the neighbor and gets pregnant. Tells her husband and he says she needs to get an abortion or he is leaving. so she gets an abortion and he leaves anyway. They get divorced and she gives up the house and everything we have. The farm and all the animals and our pets and we move up north. Im home alone almost every night so i eat dinner at the neighbors and she's always either working or at the bar. dating several different men and never home. She meets a guy and I didnt like him from the start. he used to steal money from her. He actually had a girlfriend he lived with and was having a baby with and she didnt seem to care. while he was having sex with multiple women. he gave me the creeps though and when i told my mum she said i was being a brat because i was mad about the divorce. when i am 12 they have 2 kids together and we have no power in our house in the middle of winter. my brothers are a year old and a newborn at this time. I cannot shower because the water is too cold in the house. So I take showers at school trying to hurry before anyone gets there. the school counselor keeps giving me clothes and its embarrassing. I run away from home and get caught immediately. Get the shit beat out of me. My mum accuses me of having sex with someone i was friends with. at this point ive never even kissed a boy. she's calling me a slut and throws me into the doorway and i cut my nose on a loose nail she says i hurt myself on purpose. Then we end up moving again because she says im going to get her arrested. im 13 and i am getting bad grades at my new school. she beats me with a studded belt all over my body and shaves all my hair off. I tell the school counselor and they do nothing about it. That summer i find out i failed 7th grade. and the beats me with the handle side of a fly swatter. the next day she screams at me that someone is coming over and ""why the f*ck are you wearing short sleeves?"" And i get beat again. I run away that night. I get a ride from a random guy and ask him to take me to the sheriffs dept. he lets me stay the night since it is so late and the next day he takes me. I tell them and I go into foster care. My mum tells them i am lying and that I am mad because I can't go out and have sex. Which is absurd. I end up with a foster family, they are religious. They do not like my alternative/dark style and so after 3 months I am sent to a new home.  The new foster family is an old couple. they have 2 other teenage girls who are 4 years older than me. The one they considered a daughter and she had been living with them since she was like 6. She hated me. I dunno why. But she was always so mean to me and treated me like crap. Well the old lady didn't seem to like me either. So the girl I shared a room with was the only one I had to talk to. One day a cupcake is missing from the kitchen and I get blamed for it. But I did not eat it. I get screamed at and then I go to school. After school my social worker picks me up and says that Im going to a new home. Im at the new home with the same girl who i shared a room with. She's a bit of a sl*t and is always getting me in trouble. And my depression gets really bad. I start cutting myself. When I go to school one of my friends see's my arm and tells the teacher. I'm sent to a mental health facility and am there for a year and a half. one day my social worker says If I do not go back to my parents I have to stay at the facility until I am 18. So I go back to them. A few months pass and after my final meeting with my counselor my parents decide we are moving. when we move, they do not put me back in school. They tell me I am going to be homeschooled. So I now am officially not allowed to leave the house at all. a few months pass and we are homeless. so my mums husband buys a crappy camper and we live in an rv park. i have to sleep in a tent tho. during hurricane season. the tent doesnt do good for keeping me dry at night. so i just get used to it. This goes on for 10 months and one day my step dad tries to rape me. when i tell my mum she says its my fault because i am a sl*t. We move into a house. I try to run away again but i cant. a month passes and they are drunk. they come into my room and he takes my clothes off and she holds me down. then i start crying. they stop and go to bed. the next morning she says if i ever tell anyone she will kill me. When I am 17, she leaves him and says she will make things right with me. but then goes back to him 2 months later. When i am 18 I meet a guy and he helps me run away. I'm with him and he is obsessive and he takes my phone away and accuses me of cheating. I'm with him 24/7. the last straw was when he hit me. so i meet another guy on CL and leave. I fall in love with him and right before Christmas he leaves me. I go back to my mums because i have nowhere to go now and she tries to take my phone of which i pay for. She won't let me leave the house and makes me cancel dates. I have to run away again. I backpack for a few months and end up in the west. Then I meet a guy on Facebook who I share mutual friends with. We hit it off and I move back to the south and we have been together since.

"I‚Äôm tired of worrying my friends and loved ones by posting things where they can see them so I just made this account to talk here. Talk of self harm to follow, sorry. Also it‚Äôs kind of my life story lol.

I started thinking about killing or hurting myself in high school- the summer between freshman and sophomore year I just took a fucking nosedive. I totally retreated into my head, cut off every friend I had made my first year besides literally two. I took an exacto knife from art class and started cutting my hips (because no one would see them there.) The only person who saw was my best friend while I was changing at her house. She‚Äôs not someone who shows a lot of emotion, but I‚Äôd never heard her gasp like that or seen her as shocked and hurt as I did right then. To this day, she‚Äôs the only person who knows I do that. (Also, somehow, she was willing to date me and we are still together 7 years later.) 

I barely passed high school (I think the only reason I didn‚Äôt go to summer school is because they literally forgot about me.) I remember once admitting to the guidance counselor I hurt myself, and it was a huge force of effort for me to admit that. All she said was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good,‚Äù and I never saw her again. I have no idea why I told her and not the actual therapist I was seeing at the time. The therapist might have done something. 

Then I tried college. I somehow go into a decent art school. My freshman year was absolutely fucking miserable. No friends (well, one, but we never did anything besides hang out in our rooms), horrible roommate, tanking grades. I just stopped showing up to class at one point near the end of the year because I knew it was pointless. The small scholarship I had somehow managed to get (which I think was just a result of me coming from an inner city school) was taken away within the first semester. I had just thought I might not have been able to do traditional school, but maybe I would do well in art school. Clearly, I was wrong. Obviously I dropped out. I told my parents I was taking a gap year but...lol. We all knew it was a lie. Three years later and I have zero plans to go to any college at all. 

I constantly make jokes about me dropping out around my friends and parents. I‚Äôve always done that; deflecting my pain with humor. I guess I think if I joke about it enough it‚Äôll stop hurting so much. What‚Äôs even harder is I am still close friends with my one college friend- and they are graduating in a few months from what I view as my biggest failure. 

All my friends are going to college and doing well. My girlfriend is getting an accelerated master‚Äôs degree. She‚Äôs very school smart and has always done very well. I‚Äôm going with her to a networking party in a month or so as her plus one- I‚Äôm going to support her but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm just going to start crying being surrounded by all these successful people because I know I will never be that. I‚Äôm so scared I‚Äôm going to drag her down for the rest of her life. She‚Äôs so smart and driven and is going to be very successful and I am going to work a shitty retail job like I have now for the rest of my life. I know she loves me but every time she tries to compliment me and tell me that I have value I just get angry because I feel like she‚Äôs just saying that. My brain shuts down when people try to talk to me about my future because I can barely picture myself being alive tomorrow, let alone in a few years. 

I never cut every day, just when I was feeling intense emotional pain that needed to be let out somehow. I‚Äôve never made it a full year without doing it- but some years I‚Äôve gone 6 or 7 months without. But lately I‚Äôve been thinking about it constantly. I just keep a knife in my room now for easy access. I had a party with several friends last week. After they all left, I felt lower than I had in months. It was Christmas Eve, and I was just lying in bed sobbing and bleeding from my hips. I have several plans for events and trips in january- and yet I can‚Äôt get excited for them or feel anything at all. I feel like things are going to get very bad for me (even worse than they have been) very soon. And the worst part is that it‚Äôs almost a comforting thought.

"4 am, can't sleep, as always. I really need to get this out of my chest. I apologize for the long text, but I really need some advice. My life is s complete mess atm and I don't know what to do.

Long story short, I'm 20 years old uninteresting guy, whose future has no purpose at all. I've never had a girlfriend, I'm studying a degree I don't like all and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks, with minimal chances for getting better.

It all started when I was 15. I went to the hospital because I thought I was having some sort of heart attack. After many cardiac exams, I was later diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder. Although, the fear of dying still haunts me constantly. 

 Due to this fact and some other conditions, my grades started  gradually decreasing. At the moment, I'm at the 3rd year of my graduation, studying retail management at a small university. I hate the subjects I'm studying. Every time I wake up and think about needing to the classes, I get more and more demotivated. Needless to say I already failed several subjects and my grades are shit. I can't see myself doing this professionally, but it's too late to give up now, my parents paid for 3 years of studying and I can't disappoint them and waste their money completely. Back in days, I really like Informatics Engineering and Psychology, but due to my awful high school performance, my grades weren't high enough to ingress in any of these graduations. 

My only interests now are music, sports betting, writing, photography and videogames, but there's no real way I could make money and live on that. My self-esteem is as low as it can be, no girl seems to find interest in me. I might be really ugly or I lack some serious social skills. I can count my friends with a single hand, and we usually spend most of the times playing videogames, so I don't go out that much. I find to make a good first impression sometimes, but then I always screw everything up. The only things keeping me on track are drinking, smoking, gambling and occasionally doing drugs.

I wish I had the guts to pack my things up and start a new life somewhere else, but I'm a coward. Every day is a fucking nightmare, I feel slowly getting  physically sick, depressed and more hopeless as the time goes by. I can't stand myself and my life, but I lack the power, energy and motivation to change it.",2,"hate the subjects I'm studying, failed several subjects and my grades are shit, suffer from anxiety ,"
"i ended 2016 as a recent graduate from a top notch university with a degree in probably the most unemployable field, 30k+ in debt, back at home, and cut off ties with all friends.

i predicted that 2017 would bring me a mediocre job i could've gotten in high school, that i probably wouldn't last a few months at that job, that my parents would be paying off my loans because i can't, and that i would probably stay in my room 90% of the year.

it all became true. i lasted only the training period of my job and resigned 1 week into the first full week of work. my parents' have paid 8 months for my student loans. i'm not paying rent. i'm well fed. and despite having only seen friends only 3 days at the beginning of the year then ending them off with an argument or complete silence on my end, i'm okay with it. birthday and holiday greetings unreplied to. concerned voicemails and texts gradually decreasing from daily to weekly, to monthly, to never.

as for 2018, i only predict the same. no contact with friends. me still leeching off of my parents. maybe they'll snap one day and tell me to go back to a job that i'll only end up resigning yet again because of anxiety. maybe i'll stay at the job out of guilt.

it's gotten to a point where i'm not even sad for myself. i've just accepted it. i'm just one of those examples of the ""smart"" kid growing up, following the rules, the teacher's pet that becomes unsuccessful because they only know how to live by what others tell them to do. yet, i can't even succeed in the system because once i finally made mistakes, i never knew how to cope, even up to now. and that's where i'm at. in this limbo of being an ""adult"" yet living as if i were a toddler. maybe the saddest part is my parents tolerate it.

i know at some point things will have to change. it's the in-between of not knowing what the next step is or what will fix my situation that leaves me feeling like there i don't have a reason to exist.",2,"most unemployable field, in debt,cut off ties with all friends,stay at the job out of guilt"
"I have a long story but don't feel like giving all the details right now..

I graduated high school 6 months ago. I was supposed to move elsewhere and work for about a year before deciding whether I should go to college. Those plans didn't take place, so... I've been staying at home since then.

Yet, long before that (Perhaps for the past 2 or 3 years), I've been really declining, just barely passing my classes and even failing calculus twice. Slowly spiraling into depression although I was never  sure until now.
And now that I'm out.. I'm pretty much depressed. So many things that stress and worry me. I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do.
Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.  
And just a few minutes ago, a cousin messaged me saying there was a spot I could take at a hotel that he works at. And again.. That feeling of dread, the guilt for even feeling like this, and overall just wanting to decline but not knowing how to say it.

"Been having some weird stuff happen to my personality/mood and I think that it might be depression. The only thing is that I don‚Äôt really feel sad? Here is a post I made earlier describing what is happening to /r/askdocs


I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don‚Äôt feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can‚Äôt hear it), and sometimes I don‚Äôt make any facial expressions so people think that I don‚Äôt like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don‚Äôt want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like ‚Äúdo it, stab them in the neck‚Äù or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can‚Äôt put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can‚Äôt remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.

"This is really long btw. So if nobody reads it I understand

I don‚Äôt even know how to start this off. I‚Äôm just in so much pain. My mind has become my prison. I have so much self hatred. I‚Äôm also self destructive. 

I moved halfway across the country after high school cause I thought it‚Äôd make me happy. Start new and leave all the negative behind. Move in with my dad and start working full time. I eventually move out to my own place. I was so unhappy about my job. I would also feel embarrassed to tell people where I worked. 

So my new mission was to find a better job. Family member hooked me up with a really great job. For a 21 year old kid with no degree this job was great. I was prob making too much money for someone my age lol. A lot of dumb spending and lots of drunk nights. 

The job really did help me out. I use to live in this duplex that had nasty carpet. I had no furniture and I had no plates or anything of that nature. Just my bedroom stuff, one entertainment center with a tv in my living room, and some rickety old stained blue recliner. 

Eventually I put down wood floors and furnished my entire place from top to bottom in a matter of months. I even opened up a good credit card and started building my credit. Was the first time in my life I was able to save money and not live paycheck to paycheck. Lol I even had a health savings account that later paid to have my wisdom teeth removed. I really went far and I was proud of myself for once. 

It just wasn‚Äôt enough though. I was still in so much pain. A job I loved turned into a job I loathed. I think I was genuinely happy for a couple months max. I ended up working there for two years and some change. 

I left when I decided I should go to school. I‚Äôm in a town with a great school and my family has gone to this school for generations. So I put in a month notice at my job and started taking steps to get myself ready for the college life. 

My first semester was a breath of fresh air. I loved it. I loved going to class and doing something I actually wanted to do. That lasted for a whole semester and a minimester. My next full semester? I almost failed this semester. I was very close to getting out on academic suspension. I stopped going to class halfway through. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to do it anymore.

I‚Äôm just running in circles. I think something will be good for me and I go and do it. It helps for s couple of months then I‚Äôm back to square one. The amount of hate I have for myself in just ridiculous. I don‚Äôt think I hate anything even remotely close tot he way I hate myself. 

At my school getting your ring is a big deal. Man I cannot fucking wait to get it either. But after I get it then what? Will it really make me happy?What happens when I finish my degree? Will I be happy then? Will I want more? What happens when I get a job I want? Will that be the turning point? Nothing is enough for me. It just keeps going. It‚Äôs a never ending pursuit of nothing. Fucking nothing.

"I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed.

Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. 

My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. 

I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. 

I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me. 

Sorry for the long post!

"Hi, 
do any of you have practical advice and methods on how to overcome fear? There are some things I have to do which, when I try to start them, cause me to have this intense freezing fear.  In my case it can be opening various mail or even starting to read some book. It could even be when I decide to rent a movie.

"Hey all,

Normally I try to muscle through these kinds of things on my own, but I'm having a rough go of things at the moment. Figured I'd make a post about it here and see what input some people have for me. I'm currently a 19 y/o ""sophomore"" in college, approaching what should (in theory) be my last semester at my local school before transferring to a 4-year school next fall. I'm now getting to the back end of my gen-eds, and one of the biggest reasons I went to a community college was to hopefully figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Coming out of high school and just picking a major seemed eternities away from anything I was capable of knowing, so I went the ""play it safe"" route.

I just feel as if I'm approaching a time where a decision needs to be made and I'm seriously bummed out about it right now. I've been all across the map as far as majors/program considerations are concerned, wanting to be a police officer through most of high school---&gt;being an English teacher---&gt;doing something with computers and IT----&gt;wanting to do film? As if now, I'm pretty certain that being a police officer/teacher are no longer of interest to me, but I'm juggling the most between computers and film of all things.

I've seen some older forum posts echoing similar sentiments, but really I'm just paralyzed with fear about making the wrong move. I'm generally pretty proficient with computers, but I have my doubts that I'd be able to keep up with the higher-level math requirements that come along with such a degree. I also wouldn't want to be a software dev or do coding really, and networking sounds boring to me. I just don't know of a sustainable career path that deals with troubleshooting hardware/software.

As far as film goes, I just really like video editing. Would pursue cinematography or something to that effect. With this one in particular I'm really concerned with being able to find work out of college, because so often we hear that these ""fine art"" esque degrees are a big no-no if you want job security and that's really important to me. Film school is also expensive so you have to be pretty grounded in your decision to attend. Despite the fact that I am not really cut out for a STEM related field (I've always performed better in liberal arts classes) I feel like I'd never find work.

This past semester I decided I'd not concern myself with gen-eds as much (only took Bio to get it out of the way) and have the rest be electives. In my case, I took two CIS classes (stands for Computer Information Systems), which were okay, but felt a lot like ""how to use microsoft office"" classes. Not necessarily super representative of the entire field. I even took a career class to get some more insight into potential paths. Helped a little bit but not as much as I envisioned it would.

Sorry for the essay. Bottom line is I just feel like the clock is ticking and I'm feeling seriously depressed and anxious. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone seems to be finding a path that works for them, grinding out their coursework, while I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. I feel like I'll never get to where I need to be :(

"I've been on antidepressants for around 4 or 5 years, but I'm still a mess. I have no control over my emotions, my panic attacks and general anxiety lead me to ruin friendships and relationships, I have fits of rage that also lead me to say things I don't mean but obviously can't take back, which has made me a very lonely person because no one wants to be around someone like that. I don't blame them. I lost someone that I really really love because of all this shit. It's hard on my parents, it's been hard on the people around me and that's why they leave. I've ruined so many things that I can't fix.

I hate my school. I love what I'm studying but the program at my school for it is a joke. All of the people in my program are annoying, I don't really like them. This past semester though, I started hanging out with them occasionally out of loneliness. That's not a good foundation for friendships.

This past year I've done a lot of growing, I've realized how shitty of a person I am, how selfish I am and how I've ruined every good relationship and friendship in my life. I still have no confidence, I'm still constantly paranoid, I'm always worried about my family members dying or something. I live 400 miles away from my childhood home. I have no friends where I live. My parents don't believe me when I say I have no friends. My mom says ""that's not true,"" and my dad just mocks me. Everything has gotten worse since starting antidepressants. If I hadn't started them, my anxiety and depression wouldn't have become a ""thing"" and everything would have been fine.

So this year, my goal is to get off antidepressants. So I'm going to do that. But where do I go from here? How do I take care of myself? How do I rebuild my life? How do I make friends? I need to start my life over, but how? I've ruined so much of my life. I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my parents and my sisters and my family. But I feel so hopeless.

"I am a 20 year old male who has 0 friends, never had a girlfriend, and live with my mom.  I dropped out of high school and have no interest in getting a ged. I have social anxiety, severe depression and anger.  I have been suicidal but I know it doesn't end my pain but just end my life.  I don't see myself doing that but I hate being miserable.  We get 1 life and I would like to enjoy it.  I've been alone, not leaving the house much since I was 14.  I have a lot of built up anger, boredom, and just want to enjoy myself.

Getting a girlfriend is one of my biggest goals, but even then, I feel with all my built up anger and depression, I would be very rude and a terrible boyfriend.

Some health problems I have are:
 I have hives called cholinergic urticaria(my skin becomes EXTREMELY painful when i get hot, or stressed, or whenever a person may sweat) It also affects my legs which are extremely itchy so i can't stand for too long.  There isn't really a cure for it.

things I have done the year of 2017 to help my hives and social anxiety:
I eat healthy, take an antihistamine, and exercise which signficantly helped my hives but they are still there and are creeping back.
For social anxiety I went to a psychologist for months and helped slightly but stopped because it wasn't doing anything.  I take paxil and I went from never leaving the house to going on daily walks, family holidays, and the occasional walk in stores.  I still don't have a driver's liscense.

I am also very depressed, I have social anxiety, and I have A LOT of built up anger.

I have seen psychologists, therapist, etc and it just doesn't help.  Talking about my depression does nothing.  The last psychologist helped by answering some questions involving social interaction but didn't help my depression.  I have taken meds and I am currently taking paxil but I am against using anti-depressants.  I am not embarrased by it, but I feel it is unnatural and possibly dangerous in the long run.  

The reason I am here is asking what type of job/career can I pursue with my social anxiety, hives(won't be able to do any physcial work, standing for long periods of time, a lot of social interaction, etc) I feel the best possible way is to work from home or on the computer.  

I have searched and searched and haven't found anything that would work.

A dream job for me is make youtube videos but that is 1 in a million to make a living as well as I don't think I could be entertaining with my severe depression and anger, and social anxiety.

I feel being able to save up money to move out on my own would significantly help my depression.  I hate living with my mom.  I am good at saving and am very cheap.  A studio apartment if fine with me but it seems wiser to buy a house instead.

"Can't stop the negative thinking about how everything in my life is fucked up beyond repair. Through poor decisions and also situations and circumstances out of my control, I have zero future and no way of changing anything. 

I've become trapped in a cycle of chronic pain and depression/anxiety. It's hard to tell the difference anymore between whether one causes the other or vice versa. 

I can't work because of pain and crippling depression, but I've also been denied Social Security because I've been told that I'm not disabled enough or depressed enough to where I couldn't just shove pills in my mouth and do something--not that I want to be eternally damned to living on a fixed income. 

Things were supposed to be so different. I was on my way to a rewarding career and making damn good money, then everything crumbled, and I literally lost everything. All of my intelligence and good looks didn't do anything for my life against physically disabling conditions and chemical imbalances. 

Now I can't stop the carousel of shitty thoughts that just plays over and over in my head every day. 

I have zero friends anymore, I don't talk to my family, I don't work; honestly, I barely even leave my house. My shitty ex wife has done everything in her power to punish me and alienate me from my children after I could no longer care for them half time anymore after my injuries and spiral downward. 

Now my life is so small. I'm going insane from boredom and isolation and I get full blown panic attacks trying not to think about how everything is so fucked up and how I really can't fix it. 

I have bipolar II, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and GAD.

My life is a shit show. I just want to run away and never come back but I can't actually run anymore. Lol. And I have no money. And I love my children too much to abandon them. My children keep me alive but also are part of the reason why I am so depressed and anxious about my life. Kind of fucked up in that way. 

I honestly don't know how to handle myself anymore. It's gotten to the point that I will literally just stare at my phone and lay in bed the entire day. I struggle to even put food in my mouth and when I do it's usually only so I can get drunk and not be as hungover.

I am so fucking depressed it‚Äôs like everybody around me gets their shit together everybody eventually seems to get what they want except from me I seem to lose everything that makes me happy I am 22 never had a girlfriend all I ever had gotten from a girl was a kiss and then she dumped me! I hate my life and I can‚Äôt find a job either to have my own apartment I live with my aunt and uncle and hate every second of it I wanna get out and I can‚Äôt afford it I don‚Äôt know what to do I don‚Äôt believe in miracles anymore!,2,"can‚Äôt find a job, she dumped me, everybody eventually seems to get what they want, seem to lose everything,"
"I just need to vent and I'm all alone. 

2017 started off as a great year. I had a good job, had a great girlfriend, no debt, bought a new car, had a nice apartment. You name it and I had it. Then it all fell apart. 

I feel so alone, I went from everything one day to absolutely nothing the next. I asked my girlfriend of two years to talk because she has struggled with depression and I felt that she was slipping into a spell so I was trying to help her. Turns out she was miserable and decided that day that we were going to break up and that she was moving out of our apartment that week. She left and I haven't seen or heard from her since.

Then I started drinking and realized how alone I really am. I don't have family, I don't have friends. The one friend I did have I screwed up because of my drinking. I just feel alone.

I got demoted at work. Had to start paying for an apartment meant for two by myself. I just had no one to talk to and I still don't. 

I've tried traveling and that doesn't make me any happier. I've tried going out by myself but I just can't talk to people or make friends. I feel damaged as a person. I feel like I've lost everything that makes me a real person. I can't even meet people. I talk to strangers or people who seem interested in talking to me and we get along well, but as soon as the conversation stops that's it. I've gotten numbers from girls to go out and never hear back from them. I've got numbers from guys to try and meet and hang out to try and be social and I never hear from them either.

I hate my job, I hate the city I live in, I hate how I look, I hate my inability to talk to people, but mainly I hate myself. I ruin everything I touch, I am never enough for anyone, and I am never wanted by anyone. 

I try to keep a pretty positive attitude but each day it gets harder and harder. I can't stand to look at myself, I don't even know who I am. Each day I feel more and more like I am not worth anything, that my life just isn't worth it. I wish each day to just not wake up. Each hour sitting at home in the darkness pushes me closer and closer to actually killing myself. I try to hold on, I try to push myself to see the bright side but I can't. 

My best friend doesn't talk to me, my other closest friend hates me. Every person I know that was friends with my ex and I constantly bring her up and how shes so much happier now. And to top it all off I just found out that she is now engaged. We dated for a bit over two years and it just ended. Just so abruptly. And now 9 months later shes engaged.

It kills me to think about. It physically hurts. I feel like throwing up, I'm an anxious mess; but I have no one to talk to about this. Now I'm sitting alone at work for the new years. No one is wishing me a happy new year, no one is caring that I make it home tonight, no one would even know If I killed myself.

Just when do things get better? I hate feeling worthless, I hate feeling like a burden to everyone around me, I hate being alone. I hate the feeling of not wanting to live anymore but honestly it's the only comforting thought.",2,"demoted at work, feel so alone, started drinking, don't have friends, hate how I look, worthless, burden ,not wanting to live anymore"
"For the past 5 years my New Year's Eves have been nightmares. Each year I get my hopes up to do something fun and I am disappointed. Last year my boyfriend at the time promised me we would plan an awesome New Years in the city. I almost cried I was so happy and excited because I loved him so much, I would get to be that person that got to dress up and have fun and be happy. Wrong. 
He broke up with me Christmas night. Then the next day my grandfather died. Then the whole year sucked after that. Then one of my favorite cats in the world passed away. That hit me hard. Don't judge. 

Now here I am, alone in bed, crying, watching everyone else have fun. I wasn't invited to a single thing by a single person. 

My ex that I'm still in love with has had a new girlfriend for months, that he dotes on and praises and is so happy with. I know they'll post pictures together tomorrow of their New Years together - something I so desperately wanted and never got. He hasn't spoken to me since he met her. Proving I was just worthless shit and she is a complete upgrade that he is happy with.  He doesn't care what happened to me. He got what he wanted - her - he's happy, he's forgotten me. 
And I don't want to hear any tired cliches of ""he's a douche, you have value"",  blah blah. He was only a douche to me because I wasn't what he wanted. He's a perfect boyfriend to the new girl - who is prettier and more fun and more successful than me. I don't mean shit to him, I wasn't good enough for him to put effort into. But she is. And now she's getting everything I wanted.

My friends have forgotten me.
My family doesn't care.
I'm a loser with a shit retail job, can't get a single job with my degree.

"hi. 

i had another account somewhere but i forgot the login to it, haha. but that's okay. i just wanted to check in, as a sort of outlet for myself since i don't really get the chance ever to just put my thoughts out there. 

it's the new year. happy 2018, by the way. i hope you all achieve what you wish. i spent the eve alone - by choice. i'm 18 years old, and i'm home on winter break currently from my first semester of college. i haven't really spent time with anybody since being back, though. i have my parents and two older brothers. my parents - we don't necessarily have the best relationship but it's not a bad one either. it's kind of just a mutual understanding of boundaries. i give them what they want and they don't intrude on my personal life kind of deal - you know? and my brothers, they're 11+ years older than i am. and it's not like they don't like spending time with me, it's just...they never really make themselves available for me to reach out.

my oldest brother called me minutes after the clock struck 12 to wish me a happy new year and he asked me what i was doing. and i said nothing, of course and he just told me that i could've called them. which was a nice sentiment in theory but i don't know how to reach out to someone that's never really been reachable. 

i guess right now i'm just feeling lonely. and i've realized that i've been feeling this way for a while now. i don't have anyone to talk to. and the people that i thought i did, my friends, are becoming less my friends and more so people who need/want me by convenience. i don't have anyone. but i guess that's nothing new, i just thought things had changed. and that i was living a better life in college.

speaking of, tuition sucks. when i was still in high school, everyone was just like ""nooo you'll get money to pay for school, don't worry! they practically just give money out for students to go."" or ""apply to scholarships! apply, apply, apply!"" like two opposite ends of the spectrum. but no one really walks you through any sorts of processes that you need to go through in order to pay for college. they kinda just throw it at you. i mean, thankfully i managed to get it sorted out. but too bad i had to figure it out on my own. and eventually, i'll have to pay out all these loans on my own too haha. 

i love going to college, it's fun and i feel like i can be a different person there. a more confident, self-assured one. but if i don't figure out all this money, i won't be able to go. my parents haven't really paid a single lick towards my schooling, but they want me to go to school. my mom even took $500 out of my account to use for something else. i mean, she asked to take it out but who am i to say no to my own mother? 

i'm considering just calling it quits after this next semester and maybe just go to community college for a bit then transfer? work a job at the same time too to save up. but then to me, it'll just be like i put in all that work to get myself into a nice school only to drop out. all my effort. gone. i don't know. it just always seems like there's a wall in my way whenever i just want something for myself. 

i have a lot to do. a lot of decisions to make. a lot of people to please. but a lot of people who will never be satisfied. because what i do is never good enough as i always fall short, even though i put all i have and more for those who need me.

"I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text.

In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to.

I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner.

Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry.

Hope you all have a good year.",2,"graduated, high expectations, squandered, wasted myself"
"Happy New Year everybody. I've been on Reddit for a while but didn't know this place existed. I've had depression for a few years, but in my case, my depression comes and goes. So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well. Anyway, Happy New Year, everybody.",2,work or asleep
"There‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been on my chest lately, well, it‚Äôs been there for a long time, I just didn‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôve been depressed. I‚Äôm not diagnosed, I‚Äôm too scared the doctors will tell me what I already know. Im scared that I‚Äôll have to explain to my parents that their happy, always goes-with-the-flow son is depressed. I‚Äôm scared that my dad, who‚Äôs born in raised in the back woods of Texas, will say it‚Äôs not a real condition. I‚Äôm scared that my mother will blame herself for not spending more time with me, or that she could have raised me better. I‚Äôm scared that my siblings won‚Äôt be comfortable with the fact that their brother is ill. I‚Äôm scared that my friends will abandon me when they realize I‚Äôm not the stable person I pretend to be. I‚Äôm scared that others would find out and wouldn‚Äôt want to talk to the depressed kid. I‚Äôm scared that my thoughts will get the better of me one of these days. I‚Äôm scared that it won‚Äôt get better. 

I‚Äôve just finished my first semester of college. My lack of will and drive has caused my GPA to straddle the line of academic probation which would lead to me eventually getting kicked out of my dream school. I‚Äôve come to realize just how bad my mental state has been for years now. I was able to move away from home and allowed to really look back on my life and in doing that, I realized something. I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy, or the last time I woke up in the morning and wanted to get up, or the last time killing myself wasn‚Äôt on my mind. I never had many friends so I‚Äôve withheld telling them these things when we talk. In fact, no one know about how I really am inside. Sure I‚Äôll sit there, around other people cracking jokes smiling and laughing, but deep down I‚Äôm not the one really there. That‚Äôs just one of my many mask I use to hide behind. The real me shakes uncontrollably while interacting with other people. I want to scream and run away if I‚Äôm ever around people for too long. I tell my roommates to go out without me because I can‚Äôt afford it, when really it‚Äôs so I can let my feelings out and sob without worrying about them being around. I don‚Äôt even know why I cry. I just kind of do. I can be sitting in the middle of a conversation and suddenly get this feeling like I‚Äôm getting sucked inside a deep void inside of myself and all I want to do is bawl. But I can‚Äôt. That would raise questions and those questions would lead to the real me under my hollow shell. And that really scares me. I don‚Äôt even know who ‚ÄúI‚Äù am anymore. My personality changes with every person I know. I try to avoid it. I‚Äôll binge watch a show on Netflix, I‚Äôll get lost in the story of a game, I‚Äôll connect with these wacky personalities in anime. But lately, I‚Äôve lost interest. Those shows and games don‚Äôt work like they used to. Now I just stare at a paused screen for hours because I‚Äôve just detached myself from reality. 

It‚Äôs New Years. But I‚Äôm the same me. New and exciting treads are sure to come and go but I will remain the same. It‚Äôs unlikely that I‚Äôll see next year, but maybe I‚Äôll drag through these 365 days just to see what happens. Who knows. 

I don‚Äôt blame you if you don‚Äôt read this. There‚Äôs no structure, and it‚Äôs more or less just getting all of my thoughts out that I‚Äôve kept in for so painfully long. But if you did read it, thank you? Honestly I just want this to be buried. I just felt I had to say these things before I lost my mind. Being a full time actor is exhausting lol.

"It's like this: when I can't leave my bed, when I'm crying all the time, when I'm constantly late to work, when I haven't showered in weeks, I can tell myself: these are very clear, objective signs of depression. No wonder you're struggling with everything. Be kind to yourself.

When I'm able to hold a steady job without screwing up, when I can keep in touch with family pretty consistently, when I can clean my apartment: it makes all the things I still struggle with seem to be due to personal failings rather than disorder. So I hate myself.

I can't focus enough to watch a movie or read a book? Well, you can be on the internet for hours, so you're not trying hard enough to focus.

I've completely ghosted most of my friends? Well, you can still contact your family and two of your friends, so you're not really socially anxious; you're just an asshole.

I'm slow to speak and struggle to find words? Your brain is working better than when you were REALLY depressed, so you're a boring person with nothing interesting to say. By the way, you're a lot dumber now because the real depressive episodes ruined a bunch of brain matter.

I feel ""meh"" and numb all the time? You're not trying hard enough to experience new things. You get up to go to work; you should be able to easily get up and take a walk when you have the day off.

"I have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I am a freshman in college and am currently the happiest I have been in an extremely long time. I have been dating my girlfriend for 2 months now and I have built many strong friendships at school. I felt like I was finally ready to tell my dad about what I'm going through and why high school was so hrs for me and why it has been nearly impossible for me to mend our relationship.

I believe that one of the leading causes of my depression is the family environment that I spent my high school years in. My dad worked two full time jobs because he wanted to leave corporate America so he started a business. Every day he would come home around 10 extremely stressed and irritable. Because him and my mom wanted the best for me they were extremely strict with their expectations grades. Every night would be screaming while I stared at them blankly telling them what they wanted to hear.

When I think back to 8th grade through junior year, it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling. I was scared to tell them that I was depressed because my mom is extremely protective and caring and sweet and she would do everything in her power to help me. But I don't want their help. I've stopped cutting and thoughts of suicide are few and far between.

A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my good friends tried to kill themselves. When I was talking to my dad about it he said that he just didn't understand depression and how someone could have depression but nothing to be depressed about. This made me want to share my thoughts and feelings with him even less.

Something my dad shared with me is what completely changed my outlook on everything . He shared with me that his greatest fear in life was losing his connection with me and our relationship completely withering away. I believed that the only way I could get better is if I shared with him what is going on.

After telling him about my depression a few days ago he told me that if my mom found out she definitely would not let me go back to school so she could keep an eye on me. So I'm not sure what to do with this situation. 

I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I just needed to release everything from my mind and write it down somewhere someone could hopefully see it. Other than my girlfriend I have no one to share with. Thank you for reading.",2,"extremely strict with their expectations grades,it's nearly impossible to remember anything but yelling"
"In the ass and out the eye. This has been one of the most painful and stressful years of my life. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong.

I just want about all the mistakes I made this (last?) year.

1) I took a semester off from college because I failed the semester before that. It was a big mistake that I'll now have to make up for. It strained many family relationships.

2) I didn't reach my fitness goal to finally do a pull-up. In fact, I haven't worked out the entire last month since thanksgiving threw me off my schedule.

3) I attempted suicide.

4) I failed at my attempt.

5) I went back to college and still fucked up, albeit much less so.

6) I barely got to know anyone new.

7) Despite the many compliments I receive at work, I feel they are fake and undeserved. I'm the owners son, and I know I'm a great guy, but I will always have the lingering doubt that people are nice because 'they have to be' and I'll never know who's honest.

8) Despite these compliments I'm still a kissless virgin

9) I'm so goddamn lonely.

10) I'm so lonely. I just want someone to be with.

11) I have plenty of good friends and an amazing, extremely supportive family, but for some reason, I'm still so fucking lonely.

12) I just want the lonely to go.

13) I want someone to hug me without me asking for it. I hate how I have to keep looking for attention.

14) I sent out happy new years to my closest friends and they haven't written shit back to me.

15) I'm really tired.

Alot of good things have happened this year; don't get me wrong. I've come to know a lot people and realized just how supportive my family is. But mentally, I just can't shake off this incredible feeling of worthlessness and loneliness.

"Hi everyone. Hope you're all hanging in at this difficult time of the year. 

I've had depression since I was about 13, and I'm still struggling to live with it. I had a really shitty year last year. Both my childhood dogs died over the space of 5 months, I only had a few clients as a freelancer and I lost them after falling into depression through it. Since my second dog died, I've lost 14kg (30lbs) - I now weigh just 50kg (110lbs) and I'm really struggling to find the appetite to put some weight back on. I'm 25, single, unemployed, live with my parents (this is at least somewhat normal in my country), and still don't know what I really want to do with my life in terms of a career. This isn't the first time depression has crushed me and set me back with no glimpse of things getting any better. No job prospects, no friends, no money, but I know I'm not alone and there are so many people going through so many similar things right now that are just desperate to get back on track. While every year has slowly gotten worse for me over the last five, I feel like I've earned some perspective from my depression and the mistakes I've made. Depression is a prison. I might be serving a life sentence, but with good behaviour and some rehabilitation, I might be able to leave on parole. I can't think exactly what lead to my acceptance of this sentence but I've never felt this frame of mind before, and now that I do I think I'm ready to start fighting again.

If you've been struggling for years like me, if you want to change, and you know what changes you want to make... I always find myself giving up and looking towards next year as another opportunity to start again, so just do it for yourself because you realise you need to and not because it's a new year and that's what people do. None of them last because they all watch their friends and colleagues fall off the wagon together. It doesn't work. Remember these people don't care about change the way we do. We can't treat this change as callously as they do. Ordinary people want to improve too, sure, but we *need* to improve.

Do it for yourself. Happy (or not) New Year.",2,"No job, no friends, no money, really shitty, died, alone"
"My job sucks. I know everybody and their mothers complain about working, but my job SUCKS. The bosses are total unprofessional cunts, they are uncouth and rude, they yell at everyone. They want me to do shit that I can't do.

I work at a tv repair company. they take broken tv's, they fix em, they sell em. I broke one. They are going to sue me. I reckon i have a good case, because the tv was in a prone position to get damaged. And i know i can win the case. but im still nervous and anxious.

"I am 25 soon and have been depressed since I was 15. I just can't see myself getting out of this mess. I used to think life would just ""work out"" as I got older but the truth is nothing has.

No dreams or goals. No pull in any direction. It's never changed. I hide my real self from everybody because I'd be labeled the sad guy if I did I make it known.

Like, what's the point of this cycle if all I end up feeling like is horrible and tired every day? I don't want this as a life.

My family don't know me, hell I don't even know me. I've got zero personality or character. Just a empty shell that plays a role.

Life is and has never appeared magical to me. I don't care about anything or anyone and I feel detached from society as a result.

I've done it all. Eaten a great diet, exercised daily, I don't drink or smoke or do drugs and yet my body hates me.

Sick of pretending. Money is everything and you are judged solely on your ability to make more of it.

I wouldn't wish this intense feeling of emptiness and loneliness on anybody. I want out.

I really don't know what to do. I've tried. Therapy, meds.

I hope I don't wake up soon. This life might not be for me.


How pathetic I'm telling strangers. Nobody else. I have nobody else.

"Wow, now that's Not how to start 2018. I work an office-type of a job, which has a lot of communication to do with tourists. My job is tied with issuing a lot of invoices. But today, I made about $3,000.00 worth of financial damage to the company. What's even more sad is that me and my boss, which is a great guy btw, we don't really get well along, and today he welcomed me being very happy himself! It was a very happy moment. I'm a kind of an awkward guy when it comes to communication with my boss. My awkwardness comes from severe anxiety I've evolved from childhood, because everyone was treating me bad, even strangers. It makes me happy when my boss approaches me being happy. But today, I had a lot of important invoices to issue, and screwed each and every one of them. My boss was furious. He shouted at me a lot. Now I'm at a point where I think it's either better to kill myself, or ask him to fire me. My sole point is to not have him be angry. If he's happy, I'm happy. I know, this is really weird now that I'm thinking about it. It's the same way with family. Now I'm behind my desk, alone and hoping to be alone until the end of the workday to go home, and either beat myself to sleep, or cry the soul out of me.
Anyways, because it's New Year's, he decided to handle the problems and remain happy. I can't apologise, they are mistakes I cannot un-do. However, after the storm ended, I appear to still feel a crippling depression. At one point I was considering suicide as a proper way to deal with this situation. Hear me out, I don't have a lot in my life. Anytime I try to succeed a plan, I always fail. Only thing I have in my life is my family to care about. I'm the only man in the house, and I'm still very young. Nobody, but me, could take care of my family, and this makes it impossible to travel anywhere. I feel as if I'm critically handicapped towards achieving happiness. It kills me from the inside. Everyday I strive to make myself happy from little things. But they are temporary.",2,"fire me,  everyone was treating me bad, even strangers"

"I‚Äôve always had depression, and it‚Äôs gotten really bad this year. It‚Äôs affecting every aspect of my life, I‚Äôve pushed most of my friends away, barely been talking to my family, my finances are a mess, and worst of all, my performance at work has gotten really bad. My boss is very hands off, so no one knew how behind I had gotten, what a mess I‚Äôd made of my work. Well last week I got a kidney stone and had to be out several days, and when I was gone they discovered how bad I was doing. Ugh.   
   
Now, Tuesday first thing in the morning I have a meeting with my boss and HER boss called ‚Äúdiscussion about performance‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs extremely likely I get fired. Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, I‚Äôm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much it‚Äôs eacallated this year. Let them know that it‚Äôs not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. I‚Äôm not trying to use it as an excuse, it‚Äôs just the truth. I don‚Äôt know that it will save my job, but at this point I don‚Äôt know what else to do.

**Studies :** Studying a long as fuck course with grueling hours. Regretting getting into it. But now no turning back. I'd enjoy it, or be less stressed about it if not for monstrous lecturers. Every morning I wake up thinking what will I get chewed out for today    

**Future :** Bleak. Specially job-wise. Relationships also have been forced so far, in my sad attempts to be a normal person. Marriage and kids don't look like its happening. In my culture this is undesirable. I'm the weirdo  

**Religion :**  Have to fake it. There is no freedom of religion where I am from. Sometimes normal people things make me feel conflicted. In the west its OK for casual sex, drinks etc. Here people do it too, even if they believe in God. Funny thing is, I'm the one with faith issues and yet I'm the one feeling guilty even thinking about these things.   

**Mentality :** I can't bring myself to compromise. I can't be happy if I can't make others happy or proud of me. But doing what makes me happy most likely would make people (family mostly) detest me.    

**Age :** Not getting any younger. Wasting my youth in pursuit of a grueling career. Never had any fun. People think I'm weird.

"Hello all. I‚Äôm a college freshman home for winter break. I‚Äôm feeling really alone. My old friend group from high school kinda grew away from me as I went to a different high school, so I‚Äôve been seeing plenty of snaps and Facebook posts about them hanging out together and being really close but have never been invited or even reached out to. I was really close to church friends through my junior year but I basically vanished my senior year because my dad left my family, I had to work, and I had to get myself a scholarship to college (which I did). They‚Äôre all like a big family, and while they include me in stuff, I cannot escape the feeling that I‚Äôm just a guest there, not a member of that family. 
I did get a full ride to William and Mary (I‚Äôm from Florida), which meant I go to school out of state, while most of them going to state schools. Most of them still see each other all the time and are super close, while I‚Äôve had to start over. It kinda hurts to see my college friends hanging out with their friends from home and still being super close to them while I don‚Äôt really have that luxury.
There is one guy who I think I‚Äôll be friends with the rest of my life. He was my best buddy in high school and we‚Äôre still really close. And my girlfriend, who goes to school in DC, is home too so I can see her. I‚Äôm grateful for them but wish I had a bigger friend group from home that I was still close to.
I‚Äôve loved college, but haven‚Äôt really found a new best friend yet. I‚Äôve still kinda struggled with feeling like an outsider and not really fitting in. I have plenty of surface friends, but I want a close, supportive friend group more than anything in the world, and I hope it‚Äôs not too late. Is it?
Can anyone relate to this? Is it weird to not be close with people from high school? How can I get rid of these feelings of loneliness and feeling like I‚Äôm a failure? How can I find what I‚Äôm looking for in college?",2,"ad to work, get myself a scholarship to college, m a failure, really alone"
"Like right now, I just got up. I need to feed my pets, clean the litter box, brush my teeth, start some laundry, and eat something. It feels like too much. I'm so anxious right now, and I just want to go back to bed and shut down. I don't care about today. I don't want it. 

But if I get it all done, I'll probably feel okay. That's not the case every day, but today I feel like I could get to a good place if I try. 

But then what? Tomorrow starts the same way. Too much to do. Everything's too hard and I feel sh!tty. Until I get some things done and the weight is lifted. 

Heck, even two hours from now I'll be in the same boat. There's always stuff to do. I need to clean the house, make some phone calls, shovel snow, get dressed, eat again. It never stops. 

And sometimes I can feel good when I've gotten somewhat on top of things, but what's the point? It's like an endless wild goose chase. Shouldn't I be able to just feel good, regardless of the conditions around me or what's on my to-do list? 

Also, this is just basic stuff. I don't have any kids, relationships to manage, projects or hobbies, and only about 20 hours of work a week. I'm just trying to keep myself and my animals from starving or dying from poverty, filth, or negligence. And it's so hard.

"Well let me very quickly introduce you to my pathetic life.

I'm 23, been in school from Fall 2012 - spring 2017. I started to have serious depression and suicidal thoughts in 2013. I have no friends, never been in a relationship. I've never had a job. Live at home etc etc. I'm a failure. 

I took a semester break in Fall 2017 because my GPA fell pretty low (2.1) and I have no motivation to continue school. I hate it so much. I'm wasting my parent's money. I haven't been doing well in school for a while and have taken less and less courses each semester since 2014. I hate myself for doing this.

So anyways in the fall of 2017 all I could've taken at my uni would be electives because I failed a pre-requisite only offered in summer/spring. The next wave of courses were kinda ""locked"" behind this pre-requisite. It felt meaningless to stack up on electives. My parents let me take the semester off to take some online courses not at a ""real"" university, but more of an online training program. It's alot cheaper than my normal university.

It's like a online thing where you get training from industry professionals in the games industry. During my time at uni I discovered modding and game development and found that I got pretty decent at it. I've been taking it really seriously since 2015. It's my dream to do it professionally one day. Yes, I know that is probably already making you cringe. I've been trying to build up a portfolio for a while and I feel like this is the first year where I've made some real progress. The courses I took where way above my skill level so I wasn't able to get the ""certificate"" but I learned way more and felt more excited about my life than I have in a while. I really think I can get atleast a remote job if I work hard enough this year. I know you can learn alot on your own, and I'm all for that usually. It's honestly been really helpful to get direct feedback from the instructors and I've learned workflows and really specific techniques that I don't feel I couldn't learned on my own. It feels like it gave my life a sense of purpose. 

Anyways, I told my parents I would go back to University after this one semester off but I don't think I can. The thought of going back makes me feel suicidal. Like it honestly feels if I go back I will end up hurting myself. I hate saying that but it feels so true.

Instead I want to spend another semester doing some more of these ""other"" courses I talked about to keep building up my portfolio. Is it a terrible idea to keep pursuing this portfolio thing? (instead of going to proper uni). I'd effectively be dropping out of college. I could always go back though, I'm not on academic probation (yet), and I wouldn't have to reapply for re-admission if I went back in the summer. I feel like it's unlikely I'll ever go back though.

I really want to do it but I think my parents would be incredibly against it. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with them. If I'm going to sign up for classes at my normal uni I have to do so by Jan. 9. Even just opening up the University website made me start shaking and my breathing got really heavy. I really don't think I can go back.

So, am I an idiot for wanting to take more of these game development courses rather than going to proper university? Is this a terrible idea? I don't know what to do really, I feel like I'm just stuck and going nowhere in life.

"I'm 15 and from the UK, in year 11 in secondary school. I'm male and although probably not gay, probably not exactly straight either. And I'm autistic, self-loathing and fucking stupid.

I've got two (relatively) close friends, let's call them John and Steve. I'm starting to develop feelings for John, which doesn't help my situation at all. Occasionally I play PC games with them, but I haven't recently.

I've also got an old 'friendship' group from a few years ago who I am no longer friends with because they're narcissistic dickheads who were closer to bullies than to actual friends. There are two I despise the most - let's call them Mike and James.

So, over the past year or so John's been mostly hanging around with other friends (who I occasionally talk to however would not consider myself to be friends with) and largely been ignoring me in school. I've tried to ask him to talk to me more but he pretty much ignored me. I've not told him that I have a crush on him yet but that'll probably only worsen it.

That said, occasionally for a week or so he'll start trying to talk to me over his other friends. Surprises me massively, and definitely in a positive way, yet sooner or later he just goes back to his other friends and I'm just another passing person, just another one of the 1000+ people in my school, and he's barely even acknowledging our friendship. What annoys me even more is that when I am in a Discord (voice chat app for those who don't know) call with Steve (or someone else from my school), they'll sometimes add one of John's friends to the call randomly. I'm perfectly fine with this until they say that John's calling them and leave. Why would he call them all of the time and not me? It frustrates me so much.

And then there's Steve, who's decided that he's going to go hang around with Mike and James and their friend group. I tried to talk to him a few days ago on their Discord server. Mike and Steve instead left the server to avoid me, and not long after that I was banned from the server for trying to talk to my friend on it.

So, now I've got my best friend (and crush) ignoring me in favour of other friends of his and going out with other friends, my other close friend just kinda... ignoring me and joining a group of assholes instead.

Yes, I am that guy who stands alone during break/lunch (or recess for Americans), hoping that just one 'friend' will bother talking to me.

I'm not sure speaking to my parents will be a good idea here. They're all much more outgoing and social than I am, and had more friends than me in school, and I don't think they will fully understand how I feel.

I guess I could try opening up to John, but I'm scared it'll just break down the friendship we've had for nearly 2 years (which is a long time for me). He probably still won't want to hang out with me anywhere near as frequently as his other friends, either.

I don't think Steve would understand if I did open up to him, and I can't now anyway as he's decided to block me in favour of Mike. Downright fucking brilliant.

My final option would be to try talking to one of my old friends who isn't a complete cunt to me nowadays. There are a few reasons why I haven't tried to restore my friendship with them, mostly the fact that they're always around complete cunts who they're much closer to than they ever were to me.

My school starts again on Thursday, and I know that I'm probably going to be lonely the entire term. I just need to come to terms with it.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's going to read this, and I feel somehow worse after writing all of this down, but I'm going to force myself to submit this post anyway. Sorry for the post being horribly written as well; I don't want to read it again because it just makes me feel even more shitty.

"In all shortness I just moved and tomorrow at noon I gotta hand in the keys for the old flat, but here I am on the floor in my old flat and have yet to empty all the cupboards in the kitchen and do all the cleaning.

There's at least one large car load worth of things to move and I havent got a car or a license - so cant even rent a car and get it done. First I thought to walk with things (only moved a few blocks), like I have already done two times, but it's notably difficult to do so (and since it's getting late I'm contemplating a taxi. One can use a taxi for this, right?).

I've had months to get this all done but of course here I am having procrastinated like hell and dealt with anxiety by knocking myself out cold to sleep. And since the support system is 99% parents I keep silent about this and dont wanna bother them more than this move already has. So yet again I've put myself in an utterly idiotic position of misery.

Tomorrow comes with work again but I am honestly contemplating calling in sick and dealing with this shit between morning and noon instead of now (been here all day and it is now late evening).

Another sad part is that today has actually been a very productive day compared to what I normally pull off.

It‚Äôs hard to get over a breakup when your dad doesn‚Äôt let you go out to stay busy with your barely existing friends. It‚Äôs hard when you stay at home and try to talk to your ex when you know the conversation is going to end quickly. It‚Äôs hard when you crave your ex‚Äôs company just to not feel so alone but you know it‚Äôs impossible. It‚Äôs hard knowing your friends/peers are doing just fine with you isolating yourself.

"im a 16 year old girl from england. 
ive attempted suicide 6 times in the space of (almost) 2 years because of school.
my head of year is supposed to help students with anxiety and let us sit outside her office but she just tells me to go away. i told her i was going to kill myself and she just told me to stop being dramatic. 

im feeling really suicidal right now, and i want to tell my mum because im scared im going to hurt myself, but she‚Äôll just think im attention seeking.

"I met my first girlfriend in high school, and I fell hard. She was smart, confident, gutsy, and the first person I felt comfortable talking about my kinks. She did not do anything half-assed, everything she touched she put her energy into. We were both in tech and had startup dreams. She had to run away from an abusive parent, and ended up staying at my place for a time. I thought we had a genuine connection. But she kept comparing me to her other ex, saying that he left her with high standards. Then she started college and first week she dumps me for a startup hotshot, saying she was tired of waiting for me to improve myself. 

So college came around for me, and I hyped myself up. I was going to work hard, play hard, and have a bunch of sex and meet my next girlfriend and future wife. I was going to meet my cofounder and start a cool company. But none of that really happened. Mechanical engineering was tough and ate up most of my socializing/free time. I was in a new city where I knew zero people. I fell into a rut and dropped out.

Additionally, I started thinking my current friends and family were boring, and I started distancing myself from them. In retrospect I was too harsh judging them; nevertheless I still feel disconnected from them.

I know It‚Äôs bad to not compare myself to her, but my imagination still runs wild. I cut out Facebook, Twitter, and blocked her out of my life, but I still cannot stop comparing myself to her. She is smart and got an internship for a big tech company right into college, and was getting featured in the local paper. She got invited to tech events and parties.

It‚Äôs been three years and my self esteem never recovered. I feel I‚Äôve let myself down, not finding a girlfriend and screwing up with engineering. Online dating/hookups didn‚Äôt work. The sexual frustration sucks. I don‚Äôt want to waste away my twenties being single. I thought about hurting myself, but after sleeping on it I realize that will do no good. 

I‚Äôm in a mental stalemate: I‚Äôve cut her out of my life, but I still have low self esteem. I see-saw in between being whiny about myself, and angrily wanting to punch every couple in the street. I‚Äôve tried three different therapists to little improvement, and my mopey-ness is straining my relationship with my dad. 

Things are getting better at a glacial pace, but that feeling of failure still clouts my mind. I‚Äôve binged many articles/videos (DFW, Alan Watts, School of Life, etc.), started going to sleep earlier, and started journaling. However, the feeling of failure still affects my day-to-day where I can barely keep my job. I still get discouraged on even the most minor of challenges.

"This new year looks like it might be the year I kill myself. I'm so beyond done now.

I am 26, male, and I feel like my life is over. My family financially ruined me to the point where I feel like I shouldn't even bother trying to fix my life. Due to some circumstances I ended up moving to a town I hate living in, and can barely afford. It's in the american countryside. I hate the american countryside. I deeply hate it. I've never enjoyed myself in the country. I also don't drive, so that makes it suck more. That's just venting though. Some more venting, I've been financially supporting my parents for some years to the point of abuse. I've been saving up to buy a car the last year. 3 times I made it to about 3 grand. 3 times they've taken it, once my took it mom bought herself a car instead. Broke down 2 months later too. then her husband had a heart attack. Then they got themselves an eviction notice. I paid the entirety of their rent the last 2 months. I hate them. But. I can't drive, I have no savings, I am stuck in a place I hate living with people I hate living with and I afford it by working a job I hate and I can't do anything about it because I can't drive and I have no savings, no one will help me drive and my parents keep taking my savings. So it's never going to get better. I have no friends. None. Not a single one. Not for about 3 years. I've disowned my family, aside from my mother but If by some miracle I save some money up and can leave, or she dies without leaving my homeless, then I'm done with her too. So. In my heart I've disowned my family and have no desire to ever contact anyone I share blood with for as long as I live. Which probably isn't very long.

I am completely isolated, very socially awkward, financially a failure. Well. Really I'm mostly just a failure. Like, in every way. I feel like I'm the biggest loser in the world. 

It really bothers me that I didn't do this to myself though. It would be so much better if I did this to myself, cause then I could stop it. Or I could at least take responsibility. I could have power, even if that power ruined my life it'd be mine. But. I go to work and then I basically give all my money to my mother cause she attacks and threatens me otherwise, I have no support system as I have no friends and no one that can and will actually help me, or offer a realistic answer to my problems. People offer shitty advice that has never worked. Staying positive does nothing for me. I can smile all day but It won't get me a car or put money in my pocket. No one I work with is really ""Friend"" material. I feel myself rapidly approaching 30 where ""friends"" become more irrelevant anyway. I feel like I'm going to die alone cause of it. Like, I'll never be allowed to fix up my life and meet someone. I'll never be allowed to save money. I'll never leave the american countryside that I hate living in oh so much. I really doubt I'll ever have sex again, at this point. 

I wake up everyday and the first thing I want to do is cry cause I hate being alive. Like life is a living hell, there's not a single thing about my life that is the way I actually would like. People tell me to take control without realizing I literally have none no matter how much I try, I can't be homeless cause I'd lose my job and there's no room in shelters cause they have to save so much space for women and they're at capacity with regulars. It's also winter, so I'd probably freeze to death in my area if I have to sleep outside. I want to die, but not like that. I also have no where else to go. Literally no where else. Not a single place in the world, as again, I have no friends or family. I have no power. I have no control. 

People offer advice completely ignorant of the fact that I have no resources. I can't leave the house under my own ability, I can't get up and go whenever to wherever. I also have no privacy when leaving the house cause of that. So outside of going to work I don't really leave. I feel like a prisoner. I have no power, I have no resources.

At this point I really think I should just kill myself. I'm rapidly approaching 30, I'm all alone in the world, I have no savings, my personality isn't anything anyone would enjoy at this point. I'm like broken and hollowed out. Just twisted up inside. I'm really no worthy catch in any department, as a friend or more. I often get told I'm handsome though. There's that. It's pretty worthless too. Like, girls I'm attracted too will tell me I'm attractive but my personality sucks too much for it to help. I get looks or fuck me eyes occasionally, no one really talks to me though. I was good with girls when I was younger. But. I had guy friends that would like, invite me along to places to meet women and then they started to kinda bash me and make me look bad. Like, I was bait, and a set up; so they could look good and get laid. So. That stopped. Then I self isolated. Then, I had to move. Then life isolated me. I'm in the middle of nowhere and every attempt at making friends has failed. Even meeting people in general, dating sites in my area don't have very many users. Only enough for like 3 pages in a search on POF. It's boring. I hate it. So, there's not a lot to choose from and it's already gone badly. So I'm alone. All alone. 

All alone, in a town I hate, with people I hate, wasting my time on a job I hate that doesn't actually benefit me cause I can't build up savings. I can't save up to drive. I can't save up to leave. I can't get my mother out of my life. I wake up and feel like crying. I feel like crying all day. I feel like crying now. It's like this every day. It's been like this for years now. So, waiting it out is not an option. This won't pass. It's not stopping. Nothings getting better, it's getting worse and worse. I really just can't anymore.

I think it's just time to go ahead and kill myself. I've really struggled and put in serious effort to fix my life, and it's not happening. I'm sick of assholes with bad advice and I am sick of trying.

I'm done. I am quite literally done, actually. This is the end of me.",2,"family financially ruined me, husband had a heart attack, can't drive, no savings, stuck in a place,hate, financially supporting my parents, point of abuse, have no savings"
"I‚Äôve been working on my 3rd year uni law essays every day for over a month, sitting at the same desk reading the same words writing the same thing on the same screen. I wake up, work, go to bed. I haven‚Äôt been out or socialised with anyone. It feels like Groundhog Day.

I‚Äôve been having panic attacks every day, feeling depressed all the time because I feel like no matter how hard I try, I‚Äôm going to fail and disappoint everyone, I‚Äôll never get a good job and people will think I‚Äôm a layabout.

The essays are awful, no matter what I do to try and improve them, they‚Äôre just bad, I think I‚Äôm going to fail this year and it will be a waste of thousands of pounds and 3 years of my life. ",2," 3rd year uni law,  wake up, work, go to bed,  panic attacks, fail,  disappoint,  bad,"
"Tomorrow I will be going back to school. I am not looking forward to it in the slightest. To hear where and what my classmates have been doing during christmas and NYE, and having to worry about assignments and such. It's gonna be tough. But on the plus side, it will be my last year. Hopefully after that I get lots of time to try and get better. Maybe sooner if I fail. My grades have plummeted during the last year, but I try to not think about it too much. Chances are that my disability combined with my depression will render me unable to work, and I am very fortunate to live in a country where the disabled get financial aid.

Perhaps the NEET life will give me the time I need to find interests and develop a personality beyond that shy, crippled person with few words to spare. I will also hopefully get a driver's license this year or the next. I don't know what I will do with it, but it feels nice to know that I will be able to drive. I like the idea of driving around just for the sake of it. 

2017 was pretty shitty for me. At least in some areas. I had multiple suicide attempts, but none worked. I also had romantic feelings for someone, and I even had visions for a future with them. A happy future. I haven't had something like that in years. I even paid them a visit to meet in person. It was really exciting to travel abroad to meet an online friend. With that being said, we sort of fell apart shortly after I went home. Most likely a combination of my habit of shutting myself away when depressed, in addition to their depression. Maybe we will meet again sometime. 

I'm not really sure what to think about life anymore. I don't feel much sadness. Not like I used to. Just indifference towards everything. Like I don't care about anything anymore. I should be frightened to think that I tried to end my life. Sad that I split from my romantic interest without even a goodbye. Angry at myself for how I treat myself. But there is nothing. I feel like I've experienced what I need to experience. I've been happy. I've had friends. Moments of intense pain. Anger. Sadness. Depression and isolation. A connection to someone else like no other. I am satisfied.

I can die now. ",2,"back to school, not looking, gonna be tough, multiple suicide attempts, shutting myself away, intense pain, Anger, can die now"
"19 male America. I am in a worse place than ever before and not entirely sure of who or where I am so please excuse any nonsensical bits or typos. To put it simply enough, every thought, person, and location feels bizarre and unreal and detached and profoundly difficult and overwhelming. I feel like an alien life form who has been suddenly thrown into a human life and body, even though I've had 19 years of this existence. Or maybe I feel like nothing at all in an empty vessel others take for a human. Maybe that's a better way of putting it. I have been severely depressed and anxious as long as I can remember (I tried to throw myself in front of a car when I was 7), but this feeling is new. Am I dissociating? This morning (5 PM actually, morning for me) my dad, who I really like and respect and who has been as supportive as possible for me, came to wake me and I literally forgot for a moment who he was, who I was, and where I was. Although I had been invited to a party, I had spent New Year's Eve the night before alone, crying and thinking about death and viscerally shocking myself every moment, realizing I still existed. To get back to the point of this rant, the most basic things like material objects and gravity and other people feel apart from me and almost sinister. I dropped out of high school, got a GED, and failed or stopped attending two community college classes, all the while sporadically working three different jobs all of which I was fired from or quit after about two months. I've been talking to a few girls who seem very interested in me, but whenever it comes time to seal the deal or set a date, I just... don't. I don't know why. I'm just so tired of it all and I can't begin to imagine decades more of this life without having a panic attack. Last night I began writing my suicide note even without any particular plan in mind, but it felt cathartic, realer than anything I've experienced in years. I think I'd use sleeping pills. Other than that, music, which I listen to all the time, is my only anchor. Usually I only begin to feel alive when contemplating my death. At least I have control over that, and my memory would be viewed with rose tinted glasses, better than anything I could ever actually be. This post will probably be paid no attention because that's just how life goes for me, and that's not bait for attention. Whatever. At least I could put my thoughts down.",2,"dropped out of high school, got a GED, failed, worse place, dissociating, writing my suicide, cathartic, alone, crying"

I dropped out of collage after the first semester and now I just work to keep myself afloat mentally. I just don't care enough about anything to get myself moving forward. All my relationships fail because I'm just not emotional and block everything out. New Year's Eve drank myself unconscious and now I'm back to my depressed self and self harming again.

"Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. 

At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. 

Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. 

I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs.

I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only  logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent.

I'm 20 years old and just got my first girlfriend. I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. 

I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. 

Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. 

I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn.  Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me.

Come off from a well off family. I could not work a single day in my life and live comfortably, or run our family business and easily earn 400k/yr.

Am good looking, have a girlfriend and many friends

And at the time I had a friend who also self harmed but neither one of us knew the other did it. My parents were good friends with the schools principal and he told them this which immediately led to them blaming her for corrupting me basically and no matter how many times I told them this wasn‚Äôt true they wouldn‚Äôt listen. So we‚Äôre in the hospital and my parents told the doctors this and I could tell they immediately took me/my case less serious and after a series of vague question (usually what are your grades, how clean is your room etc ) the doctor told my parents I was faking it for attention. I was put into therapy and starting out I had three therapists but over the course of a year I worked my way down to one. At the end of that year the last one was kicked off of my case. But throughout that year I still self harmed and have off and on ever since. Well now to the point ig, my mum has always told me that she cares/loves me but has done nothing to try and help me (outside of that therapy which she constantly told me was useless) I have gotten caught self harming multiple times but have never been taken to the hospital since the first time, I have told her that I feel suicidal and have been struggling with the urge to not hurt myself and I asked if I could go back to therapy. That was a month ago and she hasn‚Äôt said anything about it or even asked how I was doing. Then today I slept late because I didnt fall asleep until 7am and she was yelling at me for being lazy then told me that I‚Äôm depressed because I‚Äôm always sleeping or in my room, and then told someone else that when she didn‚Äôt know I could hear her. But there have also been times where she gets upset because I dont talk to her about stuff. I‚Äôm just wondering if someone can help me understand her thought process because I Have been trying to for years and can‚Äôt. Also sorry if this is super confusing.

"21 (M) with severe anxiety | mild depression (probably more than I admit). 

After graduating high school I did 2 years of generals in college. I didn't get my associates but I know that I'm really close and need to get that finished up. 

Before summer semester of 2016 I dropped all my classes because I hit a wall of depression, also couldn't see the Major I was in working out, and I couldn't pick a new one. I didn't want to waste money aimlessly taking classes with expensive tuition. I am currently on a leave of absence until November when I will have to begin paying my loans back if I'm not enrolled in any courses. 

Financial Standings: March of 2017 I got a full time job (40 hours a week) making $8.50/h I got a raise and will start making $10/h this pay period and my boss said that I'll get a $1 raise in the springtime. I live with my parents and they don't accept any money so 0 expenses on that front (I try not to take it for granted, I'm really grateful to them). I have a car payment of $150/month, but I plan on paying it off by March (~$3000 left). Also car insurance is about $150 a month.. I currently have ~$2000 saved up but I owe at LEAST $10k in student loans. 

I'm super demotivated and bored, nothing interests me career wise... Or at all really, I don't have many friends to hang out with, used to waste life playing video games but they're such a drag that I get bored in like 15 minutes.. I just don't know what to do at all except keep grinding my dead end job while sleeping in my parents basement. 

I guess this is just my Year-End Review... and I don't know what I'm doing...

Every time I try to talk about my issues, I end up asking the same questions over and over, borderline asking people to shower me with complements and reminders of my good qualities. My mother is annoyed to no end by this. I don't want to do the same to my friends. As stated in the title, I have lost the will to live. The timing couldn't be worse, as I'm about to start talking classes for my GED, which I will need to talk because I fucked up in high school by being lazy and not doing my homework. I don't necessarily want to commit suicide, but I feel as though I am ""at peace"". I don't care if I'm going to die anymore. Maybe at most I'll shed a tear and ask to say goodbye. But, I am not at peace, for if I were, I wouldn't have such feelings of my own insecurities and self loathing. I don't know what to do to feel better, as every time I am even the slightest bit happy, it always goes away too soon, and I miss that feeling greatly. The biggest worry right now, is my borderline nihilism, the possibility that nothing matters; there is no point. I am unsure at best about whether or not this philosophy is true.

"In the last month I spent my birthday, Christmas, and new year entirely alone. I likely failed at least one of my exams. Almost every night I've woken up in fear from a nightmare in which my only friend dies.

Two months ago was the last time I went into work and the last time I went to most of my classes. I told everyone I was too busy, but the truth is I was too anxious to leave my apartment. It felt too much like I was just failing.

Three months ago is when I discovered that my depression may be caused by a chronic vitamin deficiency, which I would have been suffering from for over 10 years without knowing. A disorder that could have equally significant impact on my brain and body, which it may have already.

This month I'm going to get checked to see if I'm right. If I am, then my dream career is a bust. If I'm wrong, I'm right back to square one and most likely going to end it. I'm in a lose-lose situation.

The only thing keeping me going anymore is the fact that I don't know how my friend would handle it. She has big dreams that she can absolutely attain, but if she cares about me even a fraction as much as I care about her then coping with my death could ruin everything. Yet at the same  time my presence in her life has been a fairly consistent cause of stress. Another lose-lose.

"I was doing fine for some time and I thought that I could start 2018 with a better outlook, but yesterday I got into a car accident and my car got towed. It's my fourth accident but my first time that I was at fault. I have a speeding ticket too that I need to go to court for in a few weeks.

When I got home, my parents yelled at me. I went into my room at 5pm and didn't get out for dinner (hadn't eaten breakfast or lunch either). I was lying there for some time, thinking about all the mistakes I've made in the last few years. Getting an F in a class, spilling water on my laptop, cracking the screen on my phone 5 times, opening up a credit card and putting myself in $2500 debt, getting an STD after having sex with a guy who was in a relationship, drinking even though it's forbidden in religion. I have also been fighting depression since last August, because I started a graduate program with no social support and all my college friends moved away. I had an appendectomy in September. I was applying to medical schools; the application process was anxiety filled and one of the scariest things I've had to go through. I got rejected by most schools and waitlisted by a few.

While lying in bed, thinking about all of the shitty things I've done in my lifetime, I remembered I have a hook that's in the corner of my room. I had asked for the hook a few years ago so that I could get an indoor hanging chair or hanging pottery but never got around to it. I also have a chair in my room. For a good hour, I seriously thought about hanging myself. Why should I continue to live if I just keep making mistakes over and over again, and disappoint my parents constantly? Why should I bother to see this year through, when it's already off to such a shitty start?

Right now, it's 3am and i'm doing a little better after sleeping it off. I got out of bed, made myself some food, and eating Ben n Jerry's to numb the pain. I'm reminding myself that a new year is NOT a clean slate, and that I won't magically become a better person or magically stop being depressed. I need to put the work and effort into bettering my life.

-or because I'm dying and wouldn't be as upset then the first option.... yikes. ",2,nothing physiologically wrong
"I think it‚Äôs safe to say that I‚Äôve been depressed for as long as I can remember. Unfortunately I never thought of depression as a possibility for me so I always debunked these shitty feelings and sadness as ‚Äújust a bad streak‚Äù.

When I came to terms with myself and realized I had a problem, it took me a long time to open up to someone and reach out to them. I opened up to my girlfriend at the time. Fuck me was that a terrible decision.

At first she was mostly supportive but as time went on I was ‚Äútoo negative‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù or ‚Äúnever satisfied‚Äù. It was almost like she completely disregarded everything I told her. It pretty much became her being mad that I was depressed.

We hit a rough patch late in my senior year and it only added onto my self hate, my stress, my anxiety, my sadness. I felt everything at once and then I felt nothing. That night I decided I would kill myself only to be unsuccessful.

She and I talked things through and when I eventually told her what happened, she didn‚Äôt just put me down,  no. She called me a liar. The relationship didn‚Äôt last much longer than that but of course when I left I was told that ‚ÄúI should have tried harder‚Äù.

It‚Äôs been half a year since I left her and I have no regrets or wishes to have her back in my life, but fuck me I hate her. I hate her so much. I hate that she was the one I opened up to. Because of the experience I had with her, J am hateful to most people nowadays.

Every day I wake up absolutely loathing the fact that I will have people to interact with. My new friendships and acquaintances are short lived because I get so agitated I leave. I‚Äôve only come to learn that nobody gives a fuck about depression

Not a single person could be bothered that I want to kill myself or fantasize about how great it would be if I got in a fatal accident. There‚Äôs nothing but pretenders in this world that will use my death as a mean to promote themselves as a good person. I can only see myself writing a scathing note about just how much I hate everyone before I die. 

Whenever I do that, I can only hope that it hurts everyone so fucking bad. Hurt them like they hurt me

"Hello everyone,

I'm a long time lurker on this sub. Like I mentioned in the title, my life has been nothing but a mess for the last 4 years. I failed university in my last semester and never managed to finish my degree in 2013 and the entire 2014. I started working in 2015 but by early 2016 I self-sabotaged myself out of a stable job due to depression from a break up with my then girlfriend of 5 years. 

I have been living like a parasite for the last 2 years - living with my parents without paying anything. My self-esteem at the moment is so low I was about to delete this very post just because I felt bad typing all of that out.

Nights after nights I go to sleep asking myself - what do I even live for? Helpless, frustrating, disappointing, sad, angry and sometimes suicidal are probably what you'd use to describe my inner thought in recent years. 

I don't know if any of you experience this but in my mind there's this voice that constantly talks down to me. ""You're a useless piece of shit"" is probably the number one thing that it keep reminding me. I never tell my parents that I'm depressed. Or that I failed uni. Or that I had a girlfriend and broke up with her after 5 years. I lied to them when they tried to talk to me about those things. I just couldn't help it. At this point that voice in my head is probably my only friend.

I don't even know if anyone cares at this point. I'm just rambling and writing random things that probably don't make any sense. But I want to get it out somehow. I decided to not delete this post after all. 

So yeah, just want to talk about my random miserable life on the Internet with strangers for god know why. If you guys have any thing to share about your life as well I will be here reading. Probably.

"Decided to go to my new primary care doctor in order to get a referral for my acute sleep apnea problem I‚Äôve had since childhood. Decided because this was the first time seeing a doctor in several years, maybe I should get what is supposed to be an annual checkup(blood test, ekg, etc.). The first thing the doctor asked me was ‚Äúare you feeling down lately? Are you depressed?‚Äù



I kind of shrugged and laughed ‚Äúehh I don‚Äôt think so‚Äù. She smile and told me it was all part of the checkup.


I told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling down, but I‚Äôm not too sure about my answer which is why I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm going to try my best to provide all symptoms and events in order for you guys to get some idea of what I‚Äôm going through.



Let‚Äôs start off with the doctor visit. Out of the blue, I started walking outside again; in the dead of winter no less. I liked to blame my tendencies to stay locked up at home on my laziness, but now I find myself taking a stroll around my neighborhood every once in a while. I never really thought I was a full blown hikikomori as I‚Äôve maintained a job for a short period where I had to interact with customers.,. I live in a very busy part of New York so there are many faces to look at and imagine where they‚Äôre all headed.


I recently applied for college as a returning student for the spring semester which is why I think it may just be anxiety or even college-mid life crisis because I am doubting my career path.



I need to prep for some of the classes as I have forgotten a lot f the materials.. it‚Äôs been a good year since I‚Äôve gone to college. I know I should be studying, but I seem to be pushing the schedule back. I even planned out my schedule on my calendar app, but I end up just deleting the notifications and telling myself that I‚Äôd do it tomorrow. I hate this part about myself because I feel this is what led me to fall so behind in school. Everyone of my peers who‚Äôve I‚Äôve cut contact with have already graduated and live a decent life, meanwhile I‚Äôve quit my job as a store clerk months ago and don‚Äôt know where the time went.




Activities? I stopped gaming but many people get into a period of malaise with this. I seem fill most of my day on reddit and watching shows when I‚Äôm not walking around outside.





 I move around the house aimlessly; idk what the deal with that is. I find myself walking into the kitchen and forgetting why I went there. I think I‚Äôm just watching what I eat. I‚Äôve lost a couple of pounds which is great.



My sleep schedule is screwed but I am not forcing myself to say in bed longer than I have to. I actually hate laying down with nothing but my thoughts because my mind drifts into odd places that make me sad. I wonder what would‚Äôve happened if my mother didn‚Äôt have issues with the first child. That would mean I would have never been born; my parents had me because the first one didn‚Äôt take.


Anyway I think about shit like that so I like to minimize my time laying in bed with nothing else but my thoughts so I end up watching shows on my tablet til I fall asleep. 


I‚Äôve also never been good with sleeping near electronic devices since I was a kid. Just bad habits I think.


I haven‚Äôt attempted or even fantasized about leaving here so I guess that‚Äôs good. I have written an apology letter to my parents though and I‚Äôm scared to know what the intent of that was.

When you look into the abyss

And the abyss looks into you,

Penetrating, objective,

He analyzes your insides

and devours your name.


----------------------------


But sometimes, only sometimes,

when you look into the abyss,

He ignores you, threes not even silence.

And nothing happens at all.


----------------------------


You would give all to the abyss,

just to get devoured by him,

Annihilation is all you ave left,

but even the abyss doesn't care about you.


----------------------------


Desperate, you cry:

‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù

Please, I just want to hear a voice.

It does not matter if it is true or not,

I just need an answer,

because that would mean I am something,

to someone.



----------------------------
However, the only thing you can hear,

is the silence in past conversations.

----------------------------


You cry, and emptiness conquers you,

the beauty of your words no longer matters,

if not even the abyss hears them.

----------------------------


Everything looks so simple, 

filling my emptiness would be so simple‚Ä¶


----------------------------

I just need to be answered,

be something to someone,

be mentioned, praised or even insulted,

But be called.

----------------------------


Only then,

When even the abyss abandoned me,

I discovered the formula to smile again.


----------------------------

And you feel the taste of a tear,

that has slipped into your tongue,

Cached by a smile.

"I've recently been going to the doctor for problems with sleeping. I have bouts of insomnia, wake up feeling like I've barely slept regardless of if I've had a decent amount of sleep and feel tired through the day. I did all the tests my doctor could possibly think of and I'm perfectly healthy. When we first started my doctor asked if I felt depressed and I dismissed it because I feel the same as always. 

Now I'm starting to wonder if it's mental rather than physical. It's been like this for a long time, sometimes better, sometimes worse. 

I looked back through a few logs I kept of how I felt when I was so tired I could barely get up to go to work, and I would often write things about feeling disconnected. I haven't thought about it for awhile, but it's still there. It's not strong or oppressive or anything like that, just sort of a general sense of being in a dream, things flow past me and nothing really matters. People stop mattering, I stop caring about stuff I love, that kind of thing. 

So I'm starting to think that maybe I am depressed, but I have a habit of self diagnosing and scaring myself. I didn't really think about it before, since I don't feel 'sad'. But it all sounds like, at the very least, there's something mental going on that's making everything messy. Maybe it's just stress? I don't know.

I think I might look into it more, talk to my doctor about it, that sort of thing. Im at the point where I don't really care what it is that's wrong, I'm just sick of feeling this way and at the very least if I know what's going on then maybe i can do something about it. 

If anyone read this I could use an opinion (I won't take it as gospel but it'd help), some support or even just tell me where to go if this isn't the right place. I don't mind either way, I think it's good to just vent sometimes to think things through.

"Its January 2nd I woke up feeling OK. Thats how it is everyday. I wake up just ""ok"". Thats how my depression is..Its always in the core of my body, but I muster up all the energy I have within to try and act how I'm ""supposed"" to act: Social, happy, positive, hard working. Today I feel as if I can't muster up that energy. I feel like if I go outside today and put on that show that I put on everyday, I might break down. It is effecting my work. I can't tell you how many times I have called out for being ""sick"" I feel like I need time off to get on medication and see a therapist regular to talk through these times. Has anyone else had to deal with depression and needing time off of work? Should I just explain to my manager exactly what is going on? He knows I get into depressive episodes like this and has been sympathetic before. I enjoy my job I just mentally feel depleted right now. I am trying to start of the new year right by being in tune with my emotions and knowing when to take a step back and be honest with people rather than lying continuously and acting like my depression is a burden to others..Thanks for reading!

"I'm making this post just to vent mainly. Here's some stuff about me:

I am a mid 20s male. I make good money, enough to save half of it and probably retire early. I have a great girlfriend that is an absolute blessing in my life. I'm decently in shape and used to be a bodybuilder but that kind of slipped away. I'm a smart person, always in the top 15% of whatever academic class. Great parents that support me. It all started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed. Later I learned that most people get depressed in grad school because it's such a shitty prospect. It has been 1.5 years since I decided to dropout from a PhD and I'm still fucking livid about how shitty it was. Like I can't move my life past it. Now my job is mostly boring and easy but pays way better.

Now here I am 2 years later and still depressed. It's just like I am watching my life fall apart in front of my very eyes unable to do anything about it. But that's the thing, I have it so good that I can't even let my life fall apart. One person told me I couldn't fail if I tried and it's like I'm trying to prove him wrong. It's like I'm trying to fail but I just can't. And I think that contributes to the helpless feeling. At the heart of my depression is just the hopelessness and lack of control that kills me. I want to feel like I'm in some sort of control over my life but it feels like no matter what I do, hard work, lazy, focus on this or that, it just feels like it doesn't matter either way. That takes all of the fun out of life for me. It feels like life turned from a choose-your-own-adventure to a roller coaster ride with a fixed track. No way to get off the ride, just have to take the shit that comes along. I'm slowly giving up all the passions I used to have because I'm either not good enough or I'm worse at stuff than I used to be. I long to be like the 21 year old version of myself. I was so happy then.

But I'm so confused because right now I live with a guy who is fat, eats unhealthy, doesn't have many friends, is annoying, no college degree, never moved out of this area. Just generally a nerd with little social skills. But he seems to be happy. And I'm so confused. How can I have so much more going for me but be miserable? I just want this to end. I want to just be satisfied and happy with my life but I can't find anything that will scratch that itch. I'm just existing and the only thing I'm looking forward to is getting a dog, retiring early, and getting married. Those are pretty cool things, but it just feels like brain is so fucked that I won't be able to enjoy it. I smoke weed (not all the time) to cope and it helps, but really just delays these feelings like I'm having now. Fuck.",2,"started going downhill when I went to grad school but realized it was a dead end and started getting depressed ,decided to dropout from a PhD"

I'm 18 years old and a freshman in college. I've had mental health issues for a while, but it has really worsened since about August of this year. I was actually having a pretty good summer, I travelled in Europe with my best friend, saw a cousin who lives in Germany and had a fun week in Paris. It was exciting and really nice. I miss those days. It feels like forever ago. I started feeling weird about a week after I got back. I kept sleeping and sleeping, so much sleep, but I was never rested... I felt tired all the time and always had a headache. My thoughts were really morbid and weird. I kept thinking about my own death, my cat's death, my parents' death... they recently turned 50, they hopefully have many years left of healthy life, but I'm scared to lose them. I started thinking about how life is so temporary and we're moving rapidly along a path toward that inevitable end, each day closer to a painful illness and death... and endless nothingness after that.
So I started college in September. I'm minoring in philosophy, and I'm taking this course called Ancient Philosophy. The professor is great. But the thing is, philosophy and astronomy are the two topics that really get me into these disturbing existential thoughts. We're reading a lot about death, and I wrote this paper about Epicurus' views on death (he is the one who said ""death is nothing to us""). I found it interesting. I realized that I somehow long for death (most of my problems arise from consciousness, and I find it very appealing to just go to sleep forever and never wake up, because I find the most comfort in sleep and am always disappointed to find myself waking up to another lousy day on earth). At the same time, the idea of ""eternal nothingness"" really creeps me out, probably because I can't imagine it and because consciousness is all I have ever known. I missed a lot of class and was late a lot this semester because I just didn't... see the point, I guess. Of doing anything. I thought about killing myself just to get it over with. I know how I'd do it and everything. I really think I will kill myself someday. I honestly am about 75% sure that my life will end in suicide; not any time soon, but eventually. I actually like the idea of suicide. In a way, I am pro-suicide for myself (I would never encourage anyone else to do this, but it's their choice). I find the idea of dying by suicide empowering because something inevitable and daunting is now put into my hands, and I control my own death as well as my own life. I told a friend this once, needless to say my friend was not amused and got worried. I don't talk to anyone about it now, they shouldn't have to worry about me, I just wonder if my thoughts are really abnormal psychologically or if that's rational (it seems rational to me, and it seems like people just think it's ""crazy"" because of the prevailing view in society that suicide is always both immoral and irrational).
I can't really talk to my parents about this. They don't believe in mental illness. I'm from a Syrian Druze family, but they're very secular and don't care about religion... and I've always found religion to be just a way of getting out of actually evaluating the world and confronting the absurdity of life. And I sort of have a negative view of it because of the destruction that fundamentalism has brought to a lot of people, it's close to the experience of people where I'm from, all for an irrational idea. At the same time I have always been a bit jealous of people who have religion to rely on. Like some of my Muslim friends or ones who are very Christian. They know God is there for them. I don't have anyone or anything. I don't know if I'm depressed. I definitely have been, but at the moment I'm fairly active, but my thoughts are never on what I'm doing, they're always on these existential problems and I'm almost always feeling despair and hopelessness, even when I'm acting social and trying to have a good time.
I sometimes feel that the world is not real, and worry that it will disappear at any moment. It feels that I am in a dream. I cannot define myself and others always seem like strangers, no matter how close a relationship we may have. Everything seems absurd to me. People I know from school and from my job are always are sighing about essays, exams, homework, work. To me it seems so strange. It seems like people act as though we are not mortal. They don't act like they are aware they will die. In the supermarket or something, I feel an urge to remind everyone ""We are temporary! We will not always exist!"" (Of course, I don't).
My life circumstances aren't bad, I've had some difficult things, like I lost a few family members and a friend from childhood. But overall, I should be grateful. My family has money, I've never had to face poverty. My parents love me, but don't understand me. I love them, but don't relate to them. I hope I don't seem ungrateful. I don't understand why I am how I am.

"I am sorry for the rant, I just feel the need to get this out. 

Today I had to stay home from work because I am too stressed and sad. Last night I had a mini meltdown and tried to just leave and go to a hotel , but my husband was able to talk me out of it. I didn't have a plan, I just wanted to get away from everything and have one night away from it all.  I have trouble sleeping at night because work stresses me out so much. I applied for other jobs and already got those rejection letters in the mail which only made me feel even worse.  I feel trapped in a job and a life that I hate. I just can't seem to get happy. I have an amazing husband, a good family,  a decent paying job, I see a therapist, but nothing seems to work or make me happy. I feel like a passenger in my own life. Like an extra in a movie. Sometimes I feel like it wouldn't't even matter if I were gone because I don't even feel like I am here anyway. I feel so detached.  I know I am depressed, and I am trying, but feel like I am being beaten down to the point where I just don't want to try anymore.  I'm tired.

"Cannot believe I am here. I am entirely unprepared for the future I never wanted. I am not suited to bear the burden of existence, the ebb and flow of life which inevitably contains suffering. Life is a beautiful golden package containing pure cyanide . Life is an atomic bomb decorated with glitter. To whom can I return this ""gift""? Where will I find my home? It's unreachable. Not even the hands which were once warm and comforting can accommodate me now. In death I find comfort, an unparalleled feeling of Liberation. Like Hal [Infinite Jest] I find myself at a crossroads between the desire to pursue a better life and the desire to succumb to my addiction entirely. Really, my desire is to escape. I am seeking an El Dorado which doesn't exist. All I want is the life of a hedonist without the repercussions, the drugs and sex minus the consequences. But in reality drugs are a destructive force (not to mention illegal) and nobody I would have sex with wants anything to do with me (understandable). I feel like a prisoner to life, trapped here against my will without the means to escape. I don't want a job, I want to be able to live without needing to sustain myself. I wish I were attractive enough to convince a child free lesbian millionaire to marry me. That way I could live a life of luxury, opulence and self indulgence, and while it certainly wouldn't be fulfilling, it would be better than this.  My soul is tainting the Earth and the Earth is tainting my soul. It's a reciprocal cycle of madness. I am unsuited to life and there is really only this issue at the bottom of everything. It is the mother. Mother. That horrible word, that vile, putrid thing. I do not hate my own mother. I simply resent her decision to give birth to me and the laws which enabled it to occur.  I wish euthanasia was legal for depressed individuals. Wretched sons of bitches, forcing me to live a life I resent.. and for what? So I can be another miserable wage slave.

"So I‚Äôve always been a reserved introverted person by nature and this had not been a problem even when I got to College. I would wake up, go to class, say a few hellos here and there and then go back to my dorm. Little did I know of people and how they actually worked and little did I even know of myself. Anyway fast forward a few times into the future, I met some people who I guess for the first time in my life, I wanted to be friends with. Now, I‚Äôm a guy who readily smiles and is polite etc and I guess something deep down inside of me really wanted to impress these folks (especially since I had no friends at the time). This I now know is a result of low self esteem but I‚Äôll come back to that. So we all decided to room together the following year and I admittedly was excited, seeing as I had only stayed by myself or with strangers before. This is where my self esteem comes into play. We signed up for apartments (3 bedrooms). The first room which was the largest was actually picked and moved in, it remained the two other rooms. 

Now these two rooms were built differently, one of which had the bathroom inside (B room) and the other had the bathroom on the outside and was smaller a bit (C room). I made a costly mistake when I actually picked the B room and signed the lease to pay for it, only for me to offer it/exchange it (while still paying for it!). Knowing who I am, I thought this was gesture of friendship or something but looking back now, this was an incredibly stupid and naive decision. 

As the semester wore on, I went from regret to sadness to depressed and just could not live with myself nor could I let go of that mistake. I began to question everything, what made me come to that decision? How could I have been so naive? No one does that. Realizing that it was low self esteem even made it worse. I began making bad decisions after bad decisions. I found myself saying yes to things I didn‚Äôt want to do, I was suffering inside. I withdrew into myself and went from reserved to just plain silent when in groups especially with these people because I could sense how stupid they thought I was. This wore on me so heavily that it affected my academics and my overall view on life and people. I‚Äôve hated myself a bit because everyday I pass that room or get the bill, it just reinforces these beliefs. 

It may sound dramatic but its true. The lease will be up in 4 months or so and I can‚Äôt wait to leave. I have also learned a lot from staying with these folks and from this entire experience even though its been a nightmare. I‚Äôm having a hard time finding myself again and although its a new year, I‚Äôll be going back to school soon and will soon meet them again. I have tried over the break to strengthen myself again and not go down the same route of trying to commit to things I don‚Äôt want to do etc this time but I‚Äôm not sure. 

How would you have done it?

I have been having some things happen to me which I think might be related to depression. The only thing is that I am not sad and don‚Äôt have self confidence problems either, but have some other things which sound like depression.

I have noticed or been told things about myself recently that I don‚Äôt feel are consistent with me in the past. My feelings are dulled, I talk in somewhat of a monotone (people tell me, I can‚Äôt hear it), and sometimes I don‚Äôt make any facial expressions so people think that I don‚Äôt like them when I really do. Often I will be in a social environment and people will say my name to pull me out of a kind of thoughtless trance where I stare off into the distance with a blank mind, I never remember it starting, just being pulled out of it by someone else. I sometimes get asked if I am high when I am stone cold sober.

I have also been having some weird thoughts, like to jump off of a balcony to my death, or violent ones like to stab someone with a knife I am holding or to crash my car on purpose. (I don‚Äôt want to do either of these things, I will just get a thought like ‚Äúdo it, stab them in the neck‚Äù or something) I would like to emphasize that I am not suicidal or even unhappy at all. Sometimes I look in the mirror and something looks off about me that I can‚Äôt put my finger on, I look like someone else. Also different people often ask me ‚Äúare you ok?‚Äù This bugs me because I am always ok, do I have a weird look on my face or something? I never hear them ask other people that, what is wrong with me, it makes me think that I am mentally challenged or something and everyone has been told except for me. There might be more stuff but I can‚Äôt remember.

All of this stuff has happened in the past year, maybe because of stress? I am a 19 year old male, moved away to college this year so big life change but these things were happening before then also. Help/suggestions much appreciated.

2017 was by far the worst year of my life but also kinda the best, because I was finally strong enough to make some changes. A little backstory: I've always been pretty insecure and shy, never had a lot of friends and was pretty quite. Then, I got into a relationship with my now ex boyfriend. He has issues. Anxiety, depression and unfortunately a couple more mental health issues. I've never had to deal with something like this in my life but I loved him and was willing to help him as much as I could. Things were fine in the beginning, even though it was super hard for me. I had to make a lot of sacrifices. He was not comfortable traveling, so I tried to accept it as good as I could, even though I always wanted to travel and see the world. He didn't want to spend time with my family. He dodged every family event, every birthday and didn't even want to have lunch/dinner together with my parents. He said he felt uncomfortable around them, so I did not force it on him. But it didn't stop there. I was not allowed to get tattoos or piercings, even though he knew that this was something I've always wanted. After a few years his mental health got worse. He also has anger management issues and started to get more aggressive. We started fighting..a lot. I started to become unhappy and this is when everything went downwards. Since he didn't want to leave the house, we ate a lot of junk food. We just had it delivered or picked it up, went into my room (I was still living with my parents) and ate by ourselves. Needless to say, I've gained a lot of weight during our 8 year relationship. 


I started to distance myself from all of my friends, right to the point where I didn't have any. I distanced myself from my family and pretty much everyone around me. I was alone, but I still had him and that was the most important thing at that moment. We had more and more fights and I started to see a different side of him. He was super manipulative and made me feel guilty, even though it wasn't my fault. He twisted my words to make me look like the bad person and he started insulting me. Calling me a the biggest bitch on earth, a manipulative psychopath and a worthless piece of shit. I didn't know what to do anymore. I became more and more unhappy and - after a few years - depressed. This led to me eating even more, because I was so frustrated so I gained even more weight, which made me even more unhappy. I still stayed with him. Thinking that he would change once we move out (as I said, I stayed with my parents and he pretty much lived there with me). As I was still in school and he had no job, I could only wait for me to finish school, him to find a decent job he could keep, so we can move in together. At that time, I also blamed my parents for being unhappy. No real privacy was possible in our house because my parents always wanted to know everything. They were pretty much always up in my business. Anyway, he kept telling me, that things would get better once we have our own place. I believed him, or let's say, I wanted to believe him so bad. But things got worse. We fought pretty much every day and he started to not only insult me but also pointing out my insecurities and telling me, that no other guy will ever want to be with me, a fat and ugly psychopath. He knew exactly what to say to break me. He did this for several years, while I endured everything my mental health got so bad, that I started to harm myself. I felt absolute worthless. There was nobody I could talk to and I was too broken to do anything. I was stuck in this shitty relationship and couldn't see a way out. I did think about suicide but was always to scared of doing it. 


I dropped out of college and was looking for a job for 1 year. I was on the verge of giving up. I didn't see any point in continuing this ""life"". I never thought I would let someone ruin my life, who was supposed to love and support me. Then, I finally got a job and made some friends at work. I actually really enjoyed going to work and seeing them, hanging out with them and being normal. The more time I spent with my co-workers, the more I thought about my relationship and that I needed to do something. Over the course of 2 years, I tried to break up with my boyfriend pretty much every month. He kept promising to change and constantly told me that I'm the only thing that keeps him alive and if I would really leave him, he would kill himself. He wants me to know that it would be my fault and he would make sure that I would never forget this. I felt like I had no other choice but to stay with him, even if it would destroy me. Fast forward to 2017, one of my co-workers (who has mental health issues himself), became my best friend and helped me through a really fucked up time. He was always there for me, whenever my boyfriend decided to throw a tantrum and blame me. I got to a point, where I almost packed my shit and left for good. I just wanted to leave and be alone. The depression and panic attacks were destroying me slowly. 


After a while, I started to develop feelings for my co-worker and he told me, that he has feelings for me as well. No, I didn't cheat on my then-boyfriend but it hit me ""there are still guys out there, that would want to get to know me, who think I'm pretty and want to treat me with respect"". I finally decided to end my relationship. It took me 4 months. 4 long months full of panic attacks, threats, tears and suicide thoughts to make it but I did it. I'm not gonna lie, it was an on-again, off-again thing with my ex for these couple of months and again, he tried again to manipulate me into taking him back and giving him another chance. I felt SO incredibly guilty for leaving him. I blamed myself for everything that went wrong in my life. We still texted sometimes, because I tried to remain friends but I knew it didn't work. I tried it because of him, hoping it would help him with the break up. Silly idea, I know. After telling him one last time, that I cannot be in a relationship with him anymore he sent me a long message, telling me that I've ruined his life, that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me and that he will find someone better and prettier than me and will make sure that I will never forget what I've done to him. He kept insulting me, like always, but this was the finale straw. I blocked him everywhere. He tried to contact me again a couple of times, sending me e-mails and shit, but I ignored them and sent them straight to spam. I cut him out of my life completely.


Up until September, I really didn't see a point and I hit rock bottom. There were times I couldn't leave my bed because this freaking depression paralyzed me. I was scared that I was going to lose my job. I mean, my life was already a mess so why not add unemployment to it. I was done, with everything and everyone. But luckily, I had some amazing friends and my family and they've helped me so much. After finally opening up to my sister about what had happened with my mental health in the past 8 years, she was shocked and told me, that she wished she knew it sooner, so she could help me get out of the relationship. After so many years of feeling worthless and thinking that nobody cared about me, I didn't know how to react to this much love and support. It was a long and incredibly difficult way but I started to hang out with my friends more often, talk to my family and in general, tried to spent more time with them, after ignoring them for 8 years. I kept thinking about the past years and how much I've missed out because of my relationship and my depression. So I finally decided to put myself first. I started to work out, eat healthier and lose weight. I got my first piercing and even though it might not be anything special, it was something special for me. It was the first decision I made on my fucking own and for myself, and only myself. After that I got my first tattoo and 3 weeks ago, I moved into my own place. All of this would have not been possible, if I didn't have the amazing support from my friends and family. 


I'm not gonna lie, I'm still not okay but I'm a lot better. I still have super shitty days and panic attacks but nowhere near as often as I used to have them. I want to be happy again. I want to enjoy life and in order to do that, I will start therapy soon. Thinking about the last year makes me so angry, sad but also happy. After so many years of psychological torture, I was finally strong enough to put a stop to it and open up to my family and get help. I have so many things to do and so many places I want to see. For the first time in years I'm actually looking forward to the future.

"A bit of background: I've been struggling for 5 years with severe depression and I'm currently in my 3rd year of college. My main drive in life has been to eventually get a job over-seas (mainly anything involving national security or humanitarian aide) to help people around the world however I can. Currently studying Political Science with a minor on International Relations and have plans to continue through law-school. 

Thing is, I'm getting really restless along the way. I have a future job in mind that only requires a bachelor's degree but I'm afraid that a degree on Political Science won't really get me anywhere in the long run so I should have a law degree to back it up just in case things don't go as planned.

I've also considered going on student exchanges but due to economic problems in my family, we've had to prioritize our expenses on other necessities. I live in Puerto Rico so we've also had to deal with the aftermath of hurricane Maria; university's been delayed for months so any chances for internships clashed with the semester's new schedule. Due to all of this, I haven't been able to fulfill that desire to travel.

I feel like there's so much going on around the world and the fact that I'm stuck for a couple more years buried in lectures is killing my motivation. I've tried to distract myself through different hobbies, volunteer work and going out with friends but nothing's genuinely helping.

Don't wanna drop out of college at all but I'm finding the road ahead really tedious. I'd like to hear how any of you have dealt with a similar kind of rut and how I could maybe find that drive again to not let my grades go down cause of my depression.

Thanks for reading and happy new year

2017 was better than 2016 for me in every way. I found a new job. I made a ton of new friends. I've taken tons more photos. I've threw several more parties this year with many more guests attending. I traveled three times in 2017, which is a lot for me. I attended way more fun events in 2017 than in 2016. I volunteered more. I ate better. I went to bed much earlier and woke up much earlier. I got many more chores done. I did a lot more reading. I've taken better care of my friends and family. I'm eating much healthier. My body looks way better. I've been going on more dates and more ""successful"" dates. I'm wasting way less money. I clean the place where I'm living way more.

I played computer games and watched TV and read the news (including Reddit) way less. Anything that doesn't feel like it's helping me take good care of myself is a distraction, and distractions were like poison to my depressed self.

"This is my first post here, so please be kind.

I am facing the following situation: 10 exams in January (Masters degree level), and a very bleak and uncertain future after that. (No, you don't get a job or internship or whatever even w/ a Masters degree, when you are as much of a loser as I am). Here's the thing though: I have been struggling with depression for a long, long time. It comes and goes in episodes. I noticed that taking the contraceptive pill Yasmin exacerbates my depression. I started taking the pill a year ago, went off it for a couple of months in the autumn, and now I had to start taking it again because my nightmarish hormonal acne started coming back.  My cheeks look like the surface of the moon ffs (just for the record, I'm 25, never had acne as a teenager; it hit me at the age of 22. Now I have both pimples AND wrinkles. yey.) I have tried everything else but Yasmin was the only thing that got me rid of the cysts. I won't stop again. As you can imagine, having a bad, cystical acne AGAIN would make me twice as depressed. With regards to the antidepressants,  I did take Cipralex last autumn but it didn't help really; if anything, it made me feel even more suicidal.

So, future is grim, but I have to push through, sadly. I am giving life one final chance - 2018 will be do or die (literally) -  cos I've taken far too many Ls so far and I am just sick and tired. If I don't get my shit together by December 31st, it's game over. 

Do you have any advice on how to proceed and make it through January? I am looking for some pill or whatever to sort of numb any emotional thoughts/feelings I have and to reduce the frequency of my nervous meltdowns and crying, while at the same time doesn't sap me completely. I need some energy to learn that stupid shit that is required for the exams.

"Hi guys, long time reader first time poster here.

A year ago I moved into an apartment in a brand new city. I remember being so excited for all the things I'd be able to do. I'd get a job, get to a gym membership, and even join a few social groups.

Well, after a year, nothings really changed. I applied for a lot of jobs and ended up going to a decent number of interviews. Nothing ever came of them and after June passed me by I lost my nerve to even really look anymore.
     I did end up getting a gym membership but I've never really used it though. I know I shouldn't procrastinate like this but I'm never able to find the energy.
     I haven't been able to find any groups or friends while I've been here either. I've looked but the only groups I've been able to find have been smaller groups that cater to people a lot older than I am. 

It's been getting harder and harder to find motivation to get out of bed or go outside for a long time now. As I don't have a car, I'd have to take the bus to go anywhere which would eat up most of my day. I haven't really been able to derive any sense or pleasure from much anything these days.

i promised my dad i‚Äôd start driving after the new year, and i plan to uphold that, maybe it‚Äôs just a hump i have to get over. we‚Äôll see. but with getting my license in 6 months, that also means that i gotta be able to pay for gas money. which means i have to get a job. 
so i‚Äôve tried to get a job before. quit after the first day. i didn‚Äôt like my position, the place itself, or the people. it was a general store that sold sandwiches and drinks and stuff like that. i was the cashier, and being a quiet person that didn‚Äôt work for me. the owner kind of humiliated me by making me repeatedly use the intercom system to call out peoples sandwich orders, saying i‚Äôm ‚Äútoo quiet‚Äù and yeah, correct me once and i‚Äôll fix it, no big deal, but don‚Äôt make me do it over and over, that just put me down. and then my friend who works there told me a few days later how the owners and some of the employees were making fun of me about how i was quiet and that i wasn‚Äôt saying thank you to the customers for their business. like yeah, i‚Äôm sorry i didn‚Äôt do that, that‚Äôs my fault, but it was my first day, i was stressed the fuck out, cut me some slack. the owners also scared me away with their whole ‚Äúyou have to uphold this expectation to the customers because our store has been here for over 75 years‚Äù, and yes i would expect your worker to be nice to customers and have good hospitality but don‚Äôt throw that at me and say that. it just scared me and turned me away.

"I often go to bed at 3-4am and wake up at 12-2pm. I know this is terrible, probably unhealthy, and also when I have to wake up early (for appointments and things) it‚Äôs the worst. 

And it doesn‚Äôt help that when I am trying to sleep, it‚Äôs hard because I‚Äôm plagued by thoughts about needing a job, not putting enough work into school, what people think of me, that‚Äôs to impossible to be with that girl I like because all I know about her is from twitter, how I‚Äôm a terrible creepy stalker weirdo for crushing on some random person on twitter, you know, the usual stuff.

But when I‚Äôm in bed after 12, and I‚Äôm watching a movie, or playing a game, or whatever, it‚Äôs the only time I can REALLY relax. 

I‚Äôm currently a college student, so this schedule works for the most part. There are lectures and things I have to attend, but those are often later in the day so it works out. 

I live with my big family, (I‚Äôm an introvert, as if that wasn‚Äôt obvious.) and while yes, I‚Äôm able to do things by myself or alone, it still feels... I don‚Äôt know, not as relaxing? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm half relaxing, but the other half isn‚Äôt.

Again my family‚Äôs big, and most of them are loud. I‚Äôm a quiet anti-social shut in, so naturally I spend a lot of time at my desk where my desktop is.... and pretty much everything else. This is setup in the most popular room in the house, so even if I‚Äôm doing something by myself and alone, 95% of the time there‚Äôs *atleast* one other person in the room.

Like I said, they can be loud, playing games, talking to online friends (jealous), and younger kids running around and playing. My two little brothers (both under 11. For reference I am 20) adore me, which is great, I love them too.... but the problem is that means they love to come a visit me, talk to me, play in the same room as me, etc.

It just feels like I never can relax... until everyone else is in bed, and I can do whatever I want and not have to worry about anything. 

**It‚Äôs like living is my job, and when I get into bed is when I finally get off work.**

My therapist is telling me ways that I can get my sleep schedule to be more normal, so that way I can have more time in the day, but I was thinking about it and... why would I want that? I never feel fully comfortable in the day, and late at night is when I can finally just forget about everything. So why would I want to take that away? I‚Äôm mean sure I‚Äôll get a lot more done, but if I have to sacrifice the only time I can fully relax, is it worth it? ",2,"not putting enough work into school, what people think of me"

I don‚Äôt know if I can do it man. Everyone says I‚Äôm smart and I‚Äôm not actually depressed and don‚Äôt have ADD when I‚Äôve talked to them so many times.

Sure, I ride bmx which is like the only thing I live for (and photography), and I‚Äôm a funny guy too. Most people even say I‚Äôm pretty attractive, like a 9/10. I‚Äôve only had one official girlfriend, and two other girls I‚Äôve had a thing with. I do know that multiple girls like me, and one of my female friends even said she liked me before, and still does, so do I, but I think we both agree on just being friends. I honestly don‚Äôt think it would be the best thing to do to try and become more than friends. She‚Äôs probably my best friend, and vice versa, and one of the only people I feel comfortable talking to about my shit, along with one other really good female friend.

"I'm sure that most people already understand this, but I keep falling back into the same shithole that's depression. The worst part of it is, I still doubt my condition, despite being told several times. Maybe it's because of my extremely young age? Not only that, I still feel I have no right to be depressed. I don't feel obligated to feel sad because I have almost everything good for me. 

I'm a lazy slob with no sense of responsibility or alarm.

At least that's the name I've settled on for now.

Currently, my friends are all sharing remorse over one of their girlfriends getting in trouble for being gay (but that's an entire different story that I won't go into) and I haven't said a thing (we share a group chat online). It's not that I don't care, it's just that I'm scared that my depression will make me sound selfish. I don't want to tell them I'm depressed because it'll likely make me sound selfish. 

Either way, I can't really win right now.

I've been holding back my feeling from them for such a long time (we've all vented to each other except for me as of now) and I don't know how long I can take it.

With that in the way, I've just been left alone, left to be the shut-in I am. 

It's already so difficult to carry a conversation with social anxiety.

I only find comfort online or in virtual/fantasy worlds so all I do is play video games.

I used to be so passionate in drawing because it made me happy, but lately it has been months since my last drawing. 

I'm a disappointment to my parents.

I cost so much money.

I do nothing to benefit anyone.

I have several chronic medical conditions including fibromyalgia. Life is literally pain for me. Physical pain.

Nothing I do makes me feel anything but sadness. I'll be doing my absolute favorite things and be fighting back tears the whole time.

All I can think about it how I'm going to have to struggle the rest of my life and it'll never get better. I won't make enough money to even take vacation or live in a nice place. I'll have to work really hard, more than healthy people, to just keep my job so I can just pay my debts and never have anything nice or any rest.

I really liked almost all of my colleagues but hated the work, as well as the studies I had to do alongside (work related qualifications).

I listen to a lot of podcasts these days but even then, if the weather is shitty and/or I can't drag myself outside then I'll just throw GTA V on and grind that whilst listening, doing the same boring missions that I stopped enjoying long ago for the in-game money that I don't even need to buy stuff that I don't even want. 

My concentration was always better in work compared to home study, but the brain is a muscle too and I fear I've lost that ability to concentrate in this time out of work. It feels like I've got dumber every single day in the pursuit of that escape. Even when I'm listening to podcasts that are educational, that doesn't matter. It feels like the brain itself has lost its processing power and memory. 

&gt;Edit regarding escapism: I feel the need to distract myself at all times. I've had a rail card application pending for around a week now, I just remembered after posting - sorting it now. How am I supposed to be relied upon to do the simplest of tasks? 

I have stopped socialising, having seen one friend once in I don't know how many months, I even stopped chatting online, having muted the group chat. I just seem to have no interest in what they're talking about and don't have much going on to talk about myself. As a social circle we don't seem to have many common interests besides football, gigs/festivals and getting wasted. 

I had a hot streak in early December with applications and got five job interviews in a week and a half or so, being successful in my third &amp; fourth choice, accepting my third choice. Admittedly it's still pretty good, pays better than the fourth as well, but it is further away. This sounds like a r/humblebrag, but the problem is that I barely did any prep for any. In fact I just relied on prep for the 4th choice, which came up first of the lot, probably ruining my chances in the others. Almost certainly the second anyway, as whilst they were both rather long shots, I thought that interview went surprisingly well - guess I'll never know if more prep could have tilted the balance. The job was far more interesting, the pay difference was pretty significant, plus I'd have gotten free train travel to and from work - I'm still massively bummed out about that.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the fact that I can't get to sleep before 4am. I'm still miraculously in the habit of waking up early, so I tend to get a few hours, wake up at around 8am, be too tired to move, fall back asleep and wake up at somewhere between 11:30 and 1:30, feeling like shit. 

I've looked into going Keto for a while now, but since as long as I can remember I'll take the lazy route if eating crappy junk food over even making a bowl of cereal, so the idea of meal prep is stressing me out no end, not to mention doing the shopping for it.

"I have no job, and I still haven't finished college. I have no friends, not mention a partner... When I check my social media, I see people that have all these things that I lack: confidence, money, intimacy, happyness. I know it's just a smokescreen, but I have nothing posted on social profile, because I don't have social events, no money nor a good job to help construct free time. I don't have self-esteem, because nobody will ever understand me, and I started isolating myself from the herd, because I wish I have studied philosophy, instead of computer science. And I hate computer science, because I am just playing with it. I don't master it, I don't understand it... therefore, I lack the skills to even be considered for a job position. Also, when an HR speaks with me in an interview, he can clearly see that I am a nervous/anxious person, which is not compatible with a youth environment. I just want to finally finish college and get a job in computer science! My obsession for thinking is also killing me, since I've also hold some unorthodox and pessimistic views, and I can't transmit any (but negative) emotion to anybody. I am more interested in philosophy, economy and politics, than in entertainment. I avoid thinking about or finding a partner, because it just makes me more aware about my holes, which in turn makes me realise that true love doesn't exist in this world. Love is materialistic, and you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit. I honestly think that paying a prostitute is a much more honest 'relation', because you recognise that everything in life is just a transaction. You exchange a service for another, and if you don't have enough resourses, you will die worthless. Meanwhile, there will be others who will have too much, and being unaware of their own privilege, they will treat you like life was just for us all along. I have come to accept this cold lesson, but whenever I tell this to others, they look at me as if I am a mad man.

Leaving my philosophy aside, I am tempted, and I want to leave things as they are... So what if I am living with my mom at home? So what if I will work at McDonalds? So what if I will forever be alone? So what if I return home tired of working, and thinking about the meaningless of life? The thought of lost opportunities, drives me more crazy, than the thought of acceptance that nothing actually matters. This whole managing my whole life, so that I can become accepted in society, and messing things aroung, makes me suicidal.

So I leave this question to you: is it worth fighting to become part of socety or is it better to accept your meaningless to them and continue your 'unfulfilled' life, knowing very well, that you will face the monotony? I am tempted to put in practice the latter.",2,"you have to be an outcast, to trully realise that nobody will ever love a jobless, depressed, unfulfilled piece of shit"

"  All my life, I've been told (I'm sixteen right now) that ""You're in kindergarten, it's going to get harder in elementary school,"" then ""If you think elementary school is bad, just wait for high school."" I'm in high school right now and it's the worst fucking time of my life. Being told that college is much harder and that I'm going to have a much rougher time is almost too much for me to just think about. I don't feel like I could go on any longer if life still only goes downhill from here.

  Just for some background, I've always been a high honor student (then honors, but that's fine since classes get harder). I've always put a lot of weight on how well I do in school, and my parents (well, my mother) would be noticeably disappointed or annoyed when I would get anything less than my absolute best. Because of pressure from myself and others combined with some kind of anxiety disorder, I've had at least twenty major anxiety attacks directly related to schoolwork and grades. And this was just in elementary school.

  Over the course of Junior High to High School, I've developed depression to add on to (and in some ways replace I guess?) the anxiety. I feel like I have no motivation to continue on doing my work, however the fear of getting bad grades still lingers, even though I can't force myself to do anything about it anymore. On my last mid-semester report card, I was failing two classes and getting Cs on the majority of the rest. I feel ambiguously about my grades now- it's tearing me apart that they're so low, yet I feel like I don't give a fuck about doing anything about it.

  And if it gets worse from here, I don't feel I want to be around much longer. But this feeling isn't new. I've completely prepared myself and stopped just barely short of attempting suicide three separate times, each time about three or so months apart from the last. A few hours ago, I stumbled across this subreddit, and I decided I'd try something new and share what's going on online.

  I was kinda afraid of sharing something so personal online to a lot of people I don't even know, but I feel that's for the better since I feel I can't actually reach for help to the people I see regularly. My father tends to get overly worked up about these things and I feel whenever I bring up the subject he panics, spends about a half an hour calming himself down, and then completely misses that I was reaching for help. My mother is the opposite, and (I think, though I may be wrong) views my having depression as a choice and a way to get out of work, as my grades have been steadily dropping, and I've been awake and active less and less. 

  And so I thank you, everyone who has gotten this far, you've been more help to me than most by simply listening to me about my situation.

So my question is, does it actually get any better from here?

"My boyfriend told me he had been diagnosed with depression when he was 15, now he's 30. He takes medication prescribed 5 or more years ago without any medical control. A year ago he had been working with therapist for several months and since than nothing has changed (both in his and mine opinions).

From the one hand, he doesn't want to work, his parents give him money (despite it's hard for them, they both work). He is a journalist, so he can write articles but he doesn't want to. From the other hand, the only thing he cares about is ""social revolution"". He has even moved to another city to be closer to his friends in a radical organization. He participate in demonstrations and so on, but he still cannot wash the dishes after dinner. Anytime I ask him why he does nothing but ""revolution"" he tells me that he has been depressed for 15 years. In the same time he has no depression-related pain, he enjoys food and sex, he sleeps well even without taking his magic pills.

I'm an activist too, but I have two jobs, study languages and do at least something. I had two derpessions in my life, I took medication and I still visit my therapist several times a month. I know what depression is, but if I have depression and realize it than I go to psychiatrist or therapist and do whatever they prescribe. Why doesn't he even visit a doctor, if he tells he's sick?

To my mind, he is trying to get rid of any responsibility in his life, so he has ""depression"". We've been together for 2 years, I love him, everything is ok when I don't ask him about doing something. As soon as I do, ""depression"" comes. 

I don't know what to do. I want to stay with him, but not with his ""depression"". I see my father living in a kind of similar condition, and I don't want to be his sponsor or feel guilt for ""not being empathic enough"", doing whatever he needs, as my mother does.

"I feel as if depression has turned me into some sort of subhuman creature. Every time I talk to one of my friends, they tell me about their days stuffed full of classes and going out and traveling and somehow still fitting in basic care of themselves and their homes. They talk about living their best lives, and how they are in their prime. I feel like I am talking to a completely different species. 

It takes an incredible amount of mental willpower to get myself out of bed in the morning and feed myself. I can't fathom having the energy to work, go to school, take care of myself, dedicate time to friends, hygiene, cooking, cleaning, planning, and more all in one day, every day. But everyone I know around me my age seems to be managing such a busy, full life.

"For my most of my life I wanted to be a musician. My best friend and I were in a band together and we were building something.  However, as I entered my mid-20s and entered a serious relationship, I felt competing priorities and wanted to potentially pursue career paths that had more stability and less time away for things like touring. 

Since then, I've been locked in paralysis for over a year about I should be doing with my life. I feel a lot of regret about leaving the music path, yet don't feel confident enough to rejoin it either. Similarly, I feel hopeless attempting to commit myself to another path that will make me fulfilled. 

The more I think about things and analyze them, the more my brain takes me down a dangerous path of regret, anxiety, and despair.

"I went to therapy for a few sessions and the book ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" was required reading. The book highlights unhealthy thinking patterns and trains you in how to spot them. I've found that All or Nothing thinking is a root to much of my hopelessness and causes self fulfilling prophecies. 

For example, I assume that I'm going to suck at a job and never get promoted, so I don't try hard because I view the effort as futile. The prediction therefore fulfills itself.  

I recommend this powerful, encouraging book, it's available in B&amp;N for about $12.00. It's the foundation of all modern Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that modern psychologists use.

"I'm a 38(m), and I've been taking Cymbalta for a little over a year. About 2 months ago, I started feeling very depressed again for no reason, and having bouts of extreme anger. I informed my doc, and she doubled my dose to 60mg. Since then, my depression and anger have gotten much much worse.


My life is amazing right now. I have a wife who loves me and supports me through all of my depression and anxiety issues. She is learning how to talk me down off the cliff sometimes, but it is a crapshoot as to whether she is able to or not. I have two wonderful little girls, who bring me so much joy.


Yesterday, I had a terrible day all day. I can't get motivated to do what I need to do at work, and when I do, I have terrible anxiety that I'm going to fuck something up and get fired. I spent most of the day yesterday shaking at my desk, because I couldn't even make myself move half the time. I got home, and had a fight with my wife, because I was taking everything she said the wrong way, to the point that I eventually just broke down crying for NO REASON. I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing.


These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER. I had a complete breakdown, and nearly left my entire family. I'm terrified that if Cymbalta has indeed stopped working for me that I'm going to have to stop taking it, and will end up having another breakdown.

"Forgive me if my English has some errors. I'm from the Philippines and I'm going to try to explain this as clear as I can.

I have a friend/classmate who has a girlfriend, who we're gonna refer to as Jane. They are both helping each other out in their problems but Jane is also a victim of abuse and we're trying to go the right step in getting help and to keep her safe.

Jane is sexually and emotionally abused and her mother and stepfather do not care about her. Jane has been raped by her uncle during a reunion in her mother's province. They were supposed to go there again this New Year but she didn't come and came to my friend to talk about it to his parents (more on that later). Her mom wouldn't listen and disregards it and her uncle continues. Jane's also been getting thin these past few months. Her drunk cousin also raped her in a separate occasion. She also has a sister who's separated from her parents but makes up stories and once sued their mother and won. She's also not to be trusted and she also doesn't care about Jane and she is manipulative.

At the same time Jane also has an ex (lesbian/tomboy) who threatens to commit suicide if she doesn't stay with her. There were times when my friend got punched/slapped by her ex but my friend didn't fight back. Both of them and my friend are depressed and have thought about suicide but to calm things down Jane agreed to stay with her for a while. However her ex became too controlling and threathened to hurt my friend and she also made suicidal threats and is trying to break them up. Her ex also blackmailed him and hacked his Facebook and sent numerous messages but fortunately we got it back. Jane and her ex are both in the same school while me and my friend are in a different one.

My friend brought her to his parents and told them what she's been through and still going through. They had a talk about her family, her ex, and the abuse. They now provide her school allowance and sleep in her classmate's house and are planning to report them but it would need to take time and resources to demand them in court. But so far they are going to lay low and take some time for now.

"So to get straight to the point, I have struggled a lot since puberty with, well, everything in life in general. Socially / emotionally kind of fucked, dont really want to explain the details here. 
Anyway, I have almost no (close) friends, have not ever had a relationship, that kind of good stuff.
The only good thing I guess rn is that I nearly have a bachelors degree. The downside is that it took me a really long time to get it, AND it is not the bachelor I started out in. I started out in a Engineering degree, almost but not quite Electrical Engineering (lets say 85% EE), and I got bogged down after about 1-1.5 years. The first year I did not do all that badly (though the important major subjects I failed, but I still got an average amount of credits). The second year I did worse but still not bad enough to convincingly say I should quit. The third year I failed extremely hard and basically gave up. After that I switched to a different major which you could say is Engineering ""lite"". I also switched because in the last semester I took 4 classes, of which 3 were extremely tough, got extremely stressed overwhelmed, and thus failed them all. 
I am happy that at least I almost got a degree now. But I can't really say Im passionate about what I do now. So I do not really want to do a masters degree in this field.
Could not really say that about the first major I did either. But I still find it hard to decide if that was because I am fucked as a person, or because I did not put in enough effort, or because I truly dislike the material/subject. Now I dont know what to do. Starting all over again is not an option. I can finish the first degree but I doubt I want to do the masters degree that fits with that degree. Very stressed about all this shit.

Background on my interests: been a computer nerd since very young age. Loved it. Love hardware and software. Knew very early on how to build a computer and all that stuff. At the same time learned about how to install an OS, repartition, all that stuff and really liked it. I just developed from there. Dabbled in overclocking and other stuff involving ""tweaking"". Love all of that too. Never really did any programming though. Only started doing that in college. I kind of like it but dont love it. 
I am passionate about certain music. Puberty / adolescence were awful for me. Had terrible self esteeem issues (still to a certain degree) and it fucked my life up. Shitty consequences like Social Anxiety and probably some depression too. When I most needed I did not get the help I needed. Also, those who could have helped me did not or did not understand it.
So, I got into music like Nine Inch Nails, and it has become an integral part of myself. Trent Reznor is the first person to truly make me feel less alone and genuinely seems to be someone I have important things in common with. I love that feeling. Later I found the works of MJK. I like a lot of that too. Celldweller is another good one. I like to really dig deep into the music and especially also the artists behind the music, and what makes them tick. On the other hand, I find it hard to relate on a deep level with most other human beings in my life. These people make me feel somewhat more sane, without them I would feel even more alone.
There is probably more I could write about this but I think it gets the point across.

I also like a bit of photography (tend to go through phases with that) and I like some films / series a lot. 

I like cars a lot too. I am lucky enough to own a decent one. 

Finally I like doing some sports and just general exercise. I quite like running too especially when you get runners high (sometimes I get all these big vision of ambition success which then fade quickly after).

"I know people say not being interested in previous hobbies is a textbook symptom of depression, but it kind of contradicts other things that I hear.

I'm 19 now and since around 15-16 I guess I slowly started to get more towards the state that I'm at now. I used to play a lot of video games (not to the point of completely neglecting everything else, I've always had great grades and some friends in real life) but I've slowly stopped playing them because none of them are the least bit rewarding or interesting to me.

I've tried to pick up other hobbies like reading and watching movies (they both just feel like chores that I am forcing myself to do), and I have ran cross country all throughout high school and now doing it in college through the club team at my school. It's hard to measure interest in running since it's not really something anyone does for the shear pleasure of doing it. I do feel good after a run for like an hour and I love the feeling of being impressed with my position in a 5k race and striving for a better time, but that's really it, it's not natural enjoyment I guess if that makes sense. It's all achievement driven.

I feel like I have tried so many things and I just haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years. It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college because I'm starting to wonder what's the point of it all. Even socializing with people doesn't give me much joy. Probably because I'm super socially anxious and never feel like a connect personally with anyone that much other than with close friends that I've had since elementary school, which are like 3 people.

It annoys me because I hear of antidepressants making people feel numb, but it works for them because that's better than the pure sorrow and darkness that they feel in their everyday life. But my problem is actually that I feel numb, so how the hell am I supposed to treat that? 

Like I'm not even sad very often, I just am constantly bored and seeking something that actually would grip my attention. I sometimes just want to sit and stare at a wall for a few hours because it's as entertaining as anything else and requires the least amount of mental energy.

So I guess therapy could work for this? Thanks for any help. ",2,"haven't truly enjoyed an experience in the past few years, It sucks because it's killing my motivation to do well now in college"

"I'm currently underemployed as a sub teacher, but hardly do that.  I've let my mental health get out of control, as well as a string of bad luck that exacerbated my problems that was out of my control more or less.  I feel really committed to turning my life around and not feeling mentally ill or bad or whatever, but I don't know when to say ""Today was a good day, you did laundry, took a shower and shaved, took 1 sub job this week, and applied for one job today, exercised for three mins, meditated for 10"" 

and When to say ""that isn't enough, you can't survive this way.  You need to set the goals higher, and you should/can set them higher""

I guess, if that makes sense.  How do we set goals, do you need to practice feeling good about those goals?  As any goal achievement a good day?  I guess it's OK to feel bad about low goal achievement(IE, I shaved today, today was a good day, that feels more insane to me than thinking about killing myself)  and that you should practice feeling good goal achievement, no matter the amount or degree of goals achieved?

Is it about effort?  Can effort be enough?

"I'm 2 years away from graduating from medical school. Its been a long and painful journey that I feel has irreversibly damaged my mental health. I'm not the same person I was when I started and I don't know if its because of a past toxic relationship, school or something else. I originally went into it because I wanted to help people (bit of a cliche, I know) and I was interested in the human body. 

But now I don't know if its what I want to do. I can't focus on the work, I find it boring and I hate studying. I feel trapped and isolated. I don't get on with other medical students - I try to be friendly but the only way I can be around them is if I'm not myself. 

Increasingly, I've been drawn to the creative industry. I would say I'm quite stylish and love dressing up and coming up with outfits. There is this creative world that exists where everyone knows each other and I want so badly to be a part of it. 

The only thing is I have no skills, talents or even interests. There is nothing I love enough to work hard at. I read a post on here that said not everyone has actual talent (although, I feel like most people do) but they work hard. I've tried loads of different things but I never like anything enough to continue with it. I've tried sewing, dressmaking, painting, modelling and styling (I did actually really like modelling and sort of liked styling but got stressed out that the outfits I chose weren't good enough). 

More than anything, I wish that I was musical. If I could be anything it would be a singer or rapper or even producer. The music industry appeals to me so much - the thought of people who've never even met me from all across the world listening to music I've made and resonating with those words and appreciating my talent is amazing to me. No other job could give that. No other job is as highly renowned. Musicians have a legacy that is never forgotten. People admire them and their talent even after death. They stand for something and change cultures. 

But again - I don't have a musical bone in my body. I wouldn't even know where to start. Every musician (or anyone hugely successful in their craft) started from a very young age - I'm almost 25. I also don't have the time. I would feel very stupid trying to do it when I don't have a natural calling or even ear for it. A girl I used to know who is now a famous singer told me that if you were supposed to be doing music you would be doing music. Everyone who is successful naturally fell into that path and worked hard at it. No one randomly says 'I want to be a rapper today' (or an actor or a fashion designer) with no experience or talent and then becomes one. 

Not knowing what I want to do and not having any talents, or even anything I like a lot; on top of the pressures of medical school, which I'm struggling with, is making me feel trapped, isolated and depressed. I see a therapist. 

There are 16 year olds who have done bigger things than me and who have more idea of what they want to do and are working towards that. I wouldn't mind if I was at the early stages of something where I wasn't very good but still knew what I wanted to do and liked that thing enough to keep going with it. I have absolutely no idea what I would want to do and be ok at or become good at, with enough work (because I don't think I could ever be good at music). I know its not supposed to be easy but I thought at least having a dream or passion would come naturally.

"Hi,
I started college this year after a gap year and I went to a major that I was really excited about and I was preparing for it. It‚Äôs arabic language and history major. 2 months in I knew something‚Äôs just not right. One of the teachers is really demotivational and the classes were really hard.

I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. 

I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations.

"Hi everyone,

First time posting here, so apologies if this is out of place.

I'm currently a 19 year old that's just started at university in Montreal, Canada. I've recently come to accept that I may have been dealing with depression throughout my life. If I think back, there have always been these periods where I've felt like I've been just barely holding on and every experience is muted. Then I come out of it and everything seems fine. Then the cycle repeats.

I've been reluctant to seek help or talk about this due to a number if factors. I'm too proud -- I hate admitting that I'm not managing the little things we have control over in life. In the positive periods, it's so easy to forget the dark ones. They've been just enough to propel me through the standard hallmarks of being ok, and then I think ""surely it can't be *that* bad"". Third, I'm still heavily dependent on my parents financially. That's sort of an endless cycle and I'm not exactly in a position to break it atm.

This past month has been the third time in 6 months that I've hit another low point, and each has been progressively lower. This time, I'm really terrified of the thoughts that keep coming up. Earlier they came up, but I was able to push them aside. Now they come up and I'm seriously (almost calmly) considering them. I've never felt more hopeless in my life. Obviously, this has been affecting me more than usual and I feel like everything is going downhill. Other than my family, I'm really reluctant to talk about it with my friends because I'm worried about how it would affect them since I know a number of them have mental illness.

I finally tried talking about how I've been feeling with my parents in these last weeks. That culminated in them finally accusing me of being a self-centered liar who was just saying things to get attention, blaming me for ""accepting negative thoughts from other people"", asking me if I'm possessed by some evil, and threatening to beat me and pull me out of university. So obviously getting their help to deal with this is not an option (which shouldn't surprise me tbh). 

I feel like I'm on the brink of really messing up, and I know it's my responsibility to seek help for this. Even if there's no way to beat it, I want strategies to make sure it never hits me this hard again.

"I'm sorry if this post ends up being long, I'll try to keep it short but please read to the end if you can. Basic background information: 20 almost 21-year-old male, I'm currently studying computer science (in my 3rd year in college). I actually took the 2017 fall semester off because of how uncertain I felt about actually studying computer science and I just felt terrible in general due to anxiety/depression. During my time off I worked to save up some money and sought help for my issues. Been going to therapy and got meds for anxiety but nothing for depression. Everything was going relatively well/getting better until I had to go back to school. My thoughts of self-doubt began to creep back in and everything just feels joyless. This always seems to happen when I feel stressed about change or literally anything else. I've lost a lot of interest in things I usually enjoy and just feel down. I feel like a failure because I'm thinking about changing my major with a year left. It'll most certainly add an extra year to my college career (I understand that this is actually somewhat common but it still makes me feel bad). To make it even worse, while I'm feeling uncertain of what to study, I genuinely have no idea what I'd study instead cause I'm so damn indecisive. I don't know where else to turn. Computer science seems cool to me but the work seems so joyless because most positions are desk jobs from what I can tell which makes me feel depressed knowing that's what's waiting for me when I graduate. I've spoken to guidance counselors, visited a few places to do job shadows, and done countless hours of career research and I'm just feeling so done with all of it.

"Hello, my name is Pranav. I am an 18 year old guy, living in India, currently in the last year of school with about 50 days to go before my final examinations. A lot depends upon my performance in these exams - most importantly, my dream of studying in Canada, and the image and respect that I've built for myself all these previous years.

**I am not at all prepared for the exams!** For 2 years now I've been struggling with inner demons (procrastination, severe escapism, depression). I went to a shrink, I took pills (stopped 4 months ago), I even saw a pseudo-psychologist with radical methods which were helpful (short-term) but very oppressive. No longer doing that either.

I have a great life, loving parents and brother, and all the comforts, leisures and resources one might need. I have potential and ambition, **but no drive**. Sometimes I feel as if I am just lazy, worthless or stupid in some way. I am certainly pitying myself, which is the worst. No surprise that I've often contemplated suicide but never did it.

I never stopped researching my own condition and I believe that I have finally come across **one helpful treatment**. It's called Metacognitive Therapy (MCT). But as it turns out, I suck so much that I didn't stick with it either!

**NOW,** here I am. A well-endowed and capable human being, with tools and knowledge. I know what to do. What action to take. But I feel shitty all the time and keep wandering off to wasting time. I got rid of my computer but I cannot do away with video games.

I feel shitty, stupid, guilty, insecure, helpless and like a failure. I am on a self-made ride for self-destruction. I have the tools and **ONE LAST SHOT AT SALVATION**. But I am guilty of self-sabotage [I have all the information that I need but I just can't break free from the vicious cycle of inaction and also **I keep gorging new information, especially spiritual stuff** even though I don't need it!]. I need help. Help and support that none around me can provide (without being judgemental). I feel lost and at the mercy of fate.

"Dunno, it striked in my head, I just writed : 

""The whole bid for submission by current managerial values is based on almost one mistake: the confusion between working and fulfilling one's potential""


Have it something right ? I'm speaking of course about the social way we are seeing work. In the way work as it is socially understood, is really one dimensionnal, like if somewhat every competency that humanity was able was separated in each individual, impacting view of life of each. We are always referencing to the quote ""work is tripalium"" and stuff in social term.
Imo it's at least currently (while not in IA society :) ) a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce (government manage work activities while work hierarchie = smooth/flat), there will be always some form of resistance finishing with creating new morality, new idea, and cutting off what work are mean to do : producing for surviving as a species.


Accomplishing your potential mean you use actually fun, you use imagination, you use discipline, you use your emotions, you use self control, you use your ability to introspect, you use your memory, perhaps ultimately a excellent work would be one that reflect the most the life wich all are actually living, meaning you have to use your memory in a global way, not being limited by artificial rule we are creating. A real work have part of actually not working, and not being managed for not working as it happen in homosexual company in silicon valley.

Isn't it a problem for those who are seeking actual accomplishment  ? I don't mean forcibly extra uppa uda mega accomplishment, just for the stuff itself. There is ppl wich are actually working better in choosen activities / in hobby mode. Aren't you more concentrated in this place than in work ? I'm not saying that writing in reddit is a higher accomplishment than your work, probably not if you are in IT for example, but writing here require more completeness than doing 1 repetitive task for all the month there another one then another one...

The main problem with trying to submit ppl with moral (like in our typical managemental way of seeing the work world) is that it end with devaluing moral itself more than being in a complying/not complying problem",2,"a false idea to modify work, because while there is a hierarchy/domination, even from outside workforce"

"This is going to be a long one.

Cliffs:
- I thought it was going to be something more 
- I wasn‚Äôt fullfilled 
- following your dreams doesn‚Äôt make you happy
- You are sold a lie to get you to consumed 

This is my story of quiting my job to travel the world and follow what I thought my passion was.

So for the past 6 months I have been planning to quit my job so I can start a travel vlog channel on YouTube and work on photography and film making. I bought some gear, I even got free products from companies because they believed in my vision. I honestly thought this was it, like I thought this was going to be my thing. I thought I was on the right path doing this. I thought this would be my dream. I thought travelling the world sharing my pics and videos would make me happy and fullfilled. So after 6 long months, the big day finally arrived. I was so excited guys like I was over the moon about it all. This wasn‚Äôt really a holiday for me this was my time to focus on my craft and work towards my goals in youtube, photography and film making. But honestly after a few days something started to change fast. I didn‚Äôt really feel good, I felt like annoyed that I had to edit this vlog or edit this photo. I became very unhappy and unfulfilled extremely fast. The only time I felt good was when I was high on mushrooms and drunk on alcohol (that was for nye only) but I started to ask myself ‚Äúhey do you even enjoy what you are doing‚Äù and to be honest I didn‚Äôt. I thought travelling the world sharing my journey with everyone would be fullfilling, I had friends and others tell me they were inspired that I had the courage to do this, I kinda felt like they were looking up to me and that my decision to do this would make them more confident for them to go after there dreams and I know that is a very positive thing but that wasn‚Äôt motivating for me at all. 

I am a simple man. I don‚Äôt give a **** about money or fame, pretty much my core value is to live a happy and fulliled life and to be surround by good people. The 9-5 isn‚Äôt for me. Hats off to you if you are ok with it but for me personally I couldn‚Äôt think of anything worse then sit in a box under arterfical light for 8+ hours a day t days a week plus the commute. When the realisation that the thing I thought was going to be my thing wasn‚Äôt was the most crushing feeling I have ever felt. It got to the point where I almost broke down. 

I have had successful online businesses in the past, but even when they were successful I wasn‚Äôt happy because I quickly realised this is like a 9-5 where I am only doing it for the money, I felt no joy or fullfillment from it so I quit. I currently do crypto investing, doing alright with it. Made 2k today but honestly yet again I felt no joy front that. I think a lot of people see other people‚Äôs lives on tv or social media and say to themselves ‚ÄúI want that life‚Äù I was the same, but I quickly realised I was sold a lie. Some of you might comment saying ‚Äúyou are just depressed bro‚Äù honestly I don‚Äôt think I am, I believe 99% of depression cases are miss diagnosed. I believe a lot of it has to do with people living unfullfied lives. Yes maybe 1% have a chemical imbalance but I strongly believe majority of people are not happy because they are not living unfullfied lives 

Right now I am thinking of just going home take some time off to revaluate. I must say though this really is painful this feeling. Thinking that something is going to be your passion and honestly believing in the bottom of your heart this is your thing but then realising (especially so fast) that‚Äô it‚Äôs not is depressing. I just wanted to make you aware that the whole ‚Äúquit your job to travel the world thing‚Äù might sound cool and all but I promise you it‚Äôs not going to make you happy. To me the only way to live a happy and fullfilled life is to do things you actually enjoy, to be on a road and to actually have some sort of direction.",2,quiting my job to travel 
"I believe I have struggled  with depression and anxiety for a long time but the past year or so seems to have dramatically increased it. 

So here's the story: 
I had been working a job at a tire shop which I didn't not enjoy with people I didn't get along with. I was seeing a girl who was in an open marriage who eventually became my best friend and biggest supporter.
I was giving the opportunity by a buddy's parents to join the merchant marines and go to the seafearers school in piney point. I was not sure if I would like it but his mom was very persistent that I do it and since joining the military was always a dream of mine but was out of the question due to my past, I agreed.
I have always separation anxiety for some reason, even though I have never felt particularly close to much of anyone or anything. I knew I would miss my family and friends and skydiving (which at one time was the only thing that really made me happy) and booze but I went into the seafearers program with all the promises of a wonderful, rewarding career making more money that I could spend. 
Well, needless to say, the ""school"" was not the prestigious, academy in which I was told. It was more or less a free labor, brain washing institution full of ignorant criminals and, pretty sure, illegal immigrants, ran by a union which I'm pretty sure is a mob front.  None the less, I got through the first phase of the school. The girl I had been seeing at home was very supportive and we texted everyday as we had for the entire year we had known each other. I was working out everyday and was reading a few self help books to try to help cope with being away from everything at home. 
Immediately after the first phase of school, you are sent directly on to a ship which I was assigned with two others from my class, one was a guy I got along with pretty well and the other was the biggest piece of shit I have ever met in my life. There were good and bad days but to be honest I really wasn‚Äôt into it, working everyday and only making $35/day however, I kept telling myself that it was a good experience and that it would be better next time. We did have shitty internet on the ship so I could communicate with my family, which was rare, but again the girl would text me everyday.
So  that tour was done after 90 days being on the ship in the middle east. Time to go home, finally.
I went home with almost no money, still living with my parents but after over 7 months, was ready to see everyone again and the girl I had left behind and to finally skydive again. This is were things turned for the worse. I soon realized that the  warm welcome home I had hoped for wasn‚Äôt what I had coming. Most of the time I sat around my house drinking alone frustrated with myself, my finances, the fact that I was 26 with almost no money, no real friends, still living at my parents who are having to pay my bills while I‚Äôm trying to get through the rest of this program, still hoping that it will be worth wild. The girl I had been talking to the past year was always busy and seemed to never have much time to hang out and we began arguing more and more because, being the jealous person I am, wanted to be with her all the time. I kept skydiving on the weekends but eventually, it became frustrating to me as well and lost most of the joy it once brought me. There were many time I would hope for a malfunction that would let me go in or times when I would consider simply not pulling. 
After about a month I went back to the ‚Äúschool‚Äù to do the third phase. I got through it and even through all our issues me and the girl who I was now very much in love with, still texted back and forth everyday. Adding  to my self hatred, I was in love with a married woman. Everyday at the school, my class seemed to be in trouble for something. Losing the few privileges that were available to us and getting assigned daily extra detail. After two long months, it was over and time to go home and await shipping assignments. I was pretty sure I wanted nothing to do with this union at this point but didn‚Äôt want to let my buddy‚Äôs parents down, they had put a lot of effort into me doing this and really wanted me to go through with it. So I decided to go home and wait for them to give me my assignment. At this point, it has been almost a year since I have made any real money and having my parents and grandmother paying the few bills I had which made me feel terrible. 
When I got home, the same problems as last time. I felt alone, completely alone. 
There was a part of me that was looking forward to shipping again. As this time I would actually be making a wage. After about a month of waiting, I was assigned a ship which I was hoping to get to see some interesting ports and make some money. Well got on and found out there is no internet and the only way to contact anyone was through a terrible company email program. Found that my wage was basically bullshit with my overtime rate being $12/hour and then I saw the ship schedule, fucking middle east again with only a few ports on the way that we were allowed to get off at for maybe an hour or two. On top of that, the cooks were awful. There was hardly a week that went by were someone wasn‚Äôt sick from the food. Then, about 2 weeks into the voyage crossing the Atlantic,  my laptop charger was surged and ruined so I couldn‚Äôt access the four terabytes of movies and books on my hard drive I had downloaded for the trip. I was able to get off in a port in Italy to try to find another charger but ended up having to buy a whole new computer just for the charger I needed.
Somehow while at sea, my debit card had been used in China for almost $800. I was able to have that taken care of but my card was canceled giving me no access to my money until I could get home to activate the new card they had sent me.
Then we got stuck in Beaumont Texas due to hurricane Harvey for weeks. One night, after things were beginning to open back up, me and another guy went out on the town. To get in and out of the port from the ship, you have to be escorted by port police from the ship to the gate and vis versa. Upon returning to the ship, I was sitting in the backseat in the middle with the other guy in the front passenger seat and the port police officer driving. The idiot cop wrecked the police truck directly into a concrete support beam sending my face flying into the steel divider of the police truck busting up my face and sending me to the hospital. After getting stitched up and a few days bac on the ship, I was eventually sent home.
Back home again, I was sent to a doctor and complained about upper back pain that radiated into my neck and shoulder pain. They told me to do physical therapy 3 times a week at their facility for 4 weeks without them taking x-rays or anything. I did that reluctantly, constantly asking to be referred to a specialist to have an mri done on my upper back and shoulder. After the therapy the doctor finally ordered an mri on September 25th. It took me a month of fighting back and forth between the shipping company and the union insurance company to get the mri  and finally got it done October 25th, the day after my birthday. Finally, I thought but come to find out, he ordered an mri on my upper neck. Not my back or my shoulder. At my follow up appointment, when confronted about it, he assured me that it was suppose to be my shoulder and back but after leaving the room for 3 hours, he returned to say that he thought my neck was more of an issue than  my shoulder at the time. My neck only hurt from the pain that was in my back which I made sure to express from day one. I asked if he was going to reorder the mri to actually look at the problem to which he replied no that I would have to deal with the pain for the rest of my life because there was nothing else he could do and he cleared me to go back to work even though I could hardly move my head, sit up straight, or lift my shoulder.
Over the next month I had hurt my knee somehow but hoped it would eventually get better. It would lock up if I bent it and the only way to get it unlocked was to go down to ground on my knees and sit back on my feet. The girl I was in love with at this point and I continued to see each other but seemed like less and less, maybe a few times a month. We went out one day I had decided to cut back on the drinking and got very drunk to the point I had to cut her off and take her back to my house. She wanted to have sex but I told her no because she was so drunk but she kept trying. She started telling me things like ‚Äúwith you it‚Äôs different, I don‚Äôt feel like  a piece of meat like everyone else‚Äù I asked her who is everyone else and she told me she gets paid to have sex and she was a prostitute. I didn‚Äôt believe her but was insistent, trying to find a so called website she was apparently on and showing me text messages from people she said she was only friends with before where she has been sending nude pictures and explicit messages. When she woke the next morning I confronted her about it to which she had no recollection and admitted to seeing and having sex with multiple other men and women but not the whole being a prostitute or getting paid for sex which she still denies to this day. Being the only person I have ever felt like I could talk to, I still talk to her, which makes me hate myself. 
Over the next few weeks I hurt my other knee and had surgery on both meniscus. I was told I would be back walking in a few days with full recovery in a few weeks before I went in for surgery.  I went in for surgery and my mom had taken me and the girl that broke my heart asked to be there, I agreed to it and they both waited during the surgery. I woke up in leg braces being told that it was worse than they thought and that I would be in leg braces for up to 10 weeks. No skydiving, no rock climbing, no running or working out, no walking except to and from the bathroom with crutches. I couldn‚Äôt believe it.
Today is the end of week 4 of being confined to my bed in my parents house to which I live. Only being able to go out for therapy and almost no one has came to visit me. The girl has a few times but it‚Äôs awkward and I keep trying to find a way to forgive her and some way to trust her, why, I guess I feel like she‚Äôs all I have. My mom has been having to do pretty much everything for me which I can‚Äôt stand. I sit here all day in bed frustrated, bored, depressed, worrying, hating everything that has happened, wondering what could possibly be next until I finally just give up and start downing any alcohol I can get my hands on. Back and shoulder still messed up. Haven‚Äôt heard anything about being able to see another doctor about that issue. Also, about a week before surgery, my clutch went out in my car. I ordered a new clutch and flywheel and rushed to get it put in before my surgery. I did but after a few hours I noticed something wasn‚Äôt right. I took the transmission back out and discovered that the paint on the flywheel melted and let the bolts holding it to the crank come loose and one snapped off. So now my car is torn apart in my dads garage possibly needing a new crankshaft.

I am constantly trying to tell myself that there is someone else out there that is way worse off than me which I know is true and that is shouldn‚Äôt complain and that things will get better but at this point, I‚Äôm no longer so sure.

"I'm approaching 28 and I think I've hit my lowest point of the last five years. I've had my issues for as long as I can remember. Particularly after my dad died in my early teens.

I get that it's supposed to prepare you for life, but it all just seemed like something I had to do so I wouldn't be bothered. Even in my senior year, I never really dreamed about ""being"" anything. 


Jumping ahead to where I am now, I've essentially done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years. I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it. I'm not really the type to talk about my feelings and all of that face-to-face, so I basically told them that I couldn't deal with it anymore. What really happened was that it was night-shift, and it was something that I hated. The one thing I've come to know about myself is that if I'm feeling depressed, lack of sleep will completely mess me up. The night I resigned, I spent the first three hours of my shift trying to keep myself from breaking down and crying in front of a group of strangers. The kicker is that I don't even really have a good reason for it. I think being there and being exhausted and doing nothing meaningful just kept building up this creeping fear that my life had no meaning. Had nothing to do with the job at all.


I was looking for work without much luck up until this point. I've been doing some online work here and there, but I suspect it won't be enough to keep everything going so I've essentially just started applying anywhere now since I'm going to start feeling the financial strain soon.


The people you get to know in blue-collar jobs are pretty straight-forward. They look at jobs and productivity, and will jump at the chance to call someone lazy if they aren't working as hard as them. I think that's what keeps a lot of these guys going, working dead-end jobs they hate. They get into this mindset of self-praise for the hard work that they do. And how they work harder than Guy B. And how Guy C is a lazy POS. So on and so forth. My room mate got very angry at me for quitting recently. He essentially said I was being lazy and I haven't had a stable job and a long time and I should be more like him. We met at a previous job and he's been there for almost 4 years now. The problem with his argument, in my mind, is that he hates it too. He's always trying to leave early or take off. And somehow, even at my worst, I seem to do better financially than him. Don't get me wrong, this post isn't to rant about him. It's more about the criticisms the people around me have.


And I suppose it would be unfair to say that I'm NOT lazy. I don't enjoy doing things that I hate, in what seems like a fruitless cycle of ""work to live, live to work"". That's not an argument you can make around these people though. I guess I would have to come out in full disclosure of how fucked up I am, otherwise I'm just being lazy.


Reading through all of these job descriptions recently makes my life seem more and more bleak. I just don't get how things seem to make sense to everyone around me, but it just won't click in my head. People will work near a decade doing something they hate but continue the cycle. On my end, I've just entered this ""numb"" feeling where I'm convinced that I'm never going to understand any of it and I should just be looking for peace from life itself.


I don't really know what I expect to hear from a post like this. I just felt like I had to share it with someone before I snap. Can anyone relate, or have general advice?",2,"done warehouse work off and on for the last 6 years, I quit my last job this November, and I'm pretty sure my family and room mate are pissed at me for it."
"and in ways that wouldn't hurt anyone if they found out. it's all very subtle, and the way i do it is mainly through poor self-hygiene. it might seem trivial, but it's pretty effective. i currently haven't showered in 5 days, and i feel like garbage inside and out. if someone finds out it's been a while since my last shower, it's whatever. they won't suspect that it comes from a place of self-loathing, and i never let it get so bad that they worry.

i will go without brushing my teeth, washing my face, showering, and changing my underwear for as long as possible without it being super noticeable or causing significant damage to my health. why care about my health? health problems can cost money, and money problems can easily become an issue for my family and not just me. and then of course, i can't have others noticing my poor health and worrying.

"Today it finally happened. I ran out of my last money. I literally don't have enough money to pay for food. I am having financial troubles for a half year now. While I'm still at school, I do a side job to pay for my study. But that employer doesn't have work for me anymore. I have to quit. I'm probably gonna fail school and a couple of months ago I let go all my relatives. Today I have like 2 or 3 friends, but none of them are the type of friends that can borrow me anything. I literally don't know what to do anymore. 

Wish a burglar would just walk in and shoot me in the head. Or a car would just run me over. I don't have the power on my side. I don't feel any love from this world. I have a belt lying beside me, but I can't bring myself to wrap it around my neck. I still have dreams, but I don't know how I can survive from here on.

"Let me start off by saying that I wasn't always this way.  I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason.  I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough.  All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day.  For the first time in my life, I failed a test.  I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression.  I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything...  I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others.  Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain.  I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly.  I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all.  Nothing crisp, anyways.  I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here.  My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care. Professionals (doctors, therapists, psychiatrists) don't seem to know what's going on with me.  My thyroid and bloodwork is fine and I got a sleep study done.  Should I see a neurologist or another specialist? ",2," first time in my life, I failed a test.

"When I was in high-school, I screwed up any and every opportunity to get into Ivy League by getting suspended.

I also just lost my scholarship to my current college because I didn't get the minimum GPA required this past semester. Though my dad is paying for my education, I don't want to burden him unnecessarily. So yes, it pains me that I lost the scholarship. And my first real girlfriend (of nearly a year) just left me in the middle of that semester. She's not coming back, either.

Guys, my resting bitch-face is turning into resting Slav-face. (No offense to genetically Slavic people...That was just the best analogy I could come up with.) That's how terrible I feel. Nothing has made me smile genuinely for more than a second--and the best ""smile"" that I've even had lately was just changing my current face into what would be my neutral expression if I were happy. Not even memes make me laugh like they should. Not even when someone else shows me one, it doesn't; and I'm not faking it because that would honestly require too much effort out of me.

I lack so much energy that it takes me thirty minutes to get out of bed. And no, I'm not on my phone or anything. I just lay there. I don't even think about anything while I lay, either; I quite literally lay in bed for thirty minutes and struggle to actually get up. And what's worse is that I don't wake up by my own volition. My dad comes in and wakes me up. Speaking of that...My own dad told me on Christmas Eve that I was ruining Christmas by being lazy and noncompliant with him. He yelled at me and told me that I was to ""change [my] attitude"" or leave the house. It's not an attitude. I don't know what to otherwise call it, though.

What's worse is that my dad hasn't let me outside of the house for the past three weeks since my break from college started. He told me ""You're going to be productive while you're on your break. The only way to succeed in college is by doing more than what's required of you."" So I've been reading my English book two months in advance and answering all the guided-reading questions that correspond to each passage from dawn until dusk. I've gotten barely any sunlight whatsoever--and this only because I have a window in my room. And I haven't gotten exercise at all.

Besides the lethargy that I've been feeling, my metabolism has went to absolute shit. I haven't eaten more than a meal-and-a-half each day...and I'm talking about ""normal-person""-sized meals: normal portions...and I'm bigger than a normal person. I weigh, like, 100 kilograms (226 lbs)...yet I've been eating like an anorexic person. In fact, I was sick earlier this vacation and vomited anything that went into my system. I literally couldn't even eat a sandwich for two straight days. And I've been sick with standard cold/flu symptoms for the past week or so.

Even my sleeping schedule is off. A normal, healthy person sleeps eight hours every day. I've tended to sleep much longer than that...and I still don't feel well-rested at all. No amount of earplugs to drown out external noise nor sleeping-masks to prevent sunlight from awakening me has actually led me to a good night's rest. I tried NyQuil, too...but that didn't give me rest. It just drained my energy and forced me to sleep. It didn't give me rest at all, though.

If I can't change this...this intense feeling of malaise, I'm not sure what I can do. I guess I'll just go to my J-term class and see if I can't pretend that it's all O.K. Maybe I'll suddenly feel better if I just can pretend...hopefully...

But the thing is that this sadness is beyond tears; beyond simple and vague melancholia. It is an emptiness; a void. Since my mother isn't really in the picture (and so only my father is really here), I guess I could say in German: ""Ich f√ºhle mich mutterseelenallein."" And I do feel deserted. But I know I deserved it. I deserve everything bad that's ever happened to me and that will ever happen to me, because I'm such a screw-up. Even my own existence is a mistake. I was adopted at birth from two people who had a one-night-stand and no intentions of ever getting married with each other. Okay, yeah, they loved me and wanted me to have life. Thanks to them.

And thanks to my adoptive mom and dad for having fed, clothed, and sheltered me...but my adoptive dad doesn't love me like he should. He wanted a child whom he could be proud of. When that didn't work for my older brother, he focused all of his yelling and threats on me...and I've been forced into subordination or else exile. He's made me into something that I'm not, and I'm not comfortable. But I don't even know what I am, because I've been forced so much to be something that I'm not. But this isn't about how my dad fails to acknowledge mental health issues; this is about how much of a terrible person I am--and I am very much such a person.

I won't go into the details, but the reason I got suspended back in high-school was because I made an ironic and edgy joke about killing myself. (Say what you will about me; any rebuke just furthers the point that I am the scum of the Earth.) No, I wasn't suicidal. I was just into extremely offensive humor at the time.

I also am a long-time user of pornography. I have seen unclad women since I was ten. Now I‚Äôm eighteen and have the worst imaginable sexual kinks. I‚Äôm so fucked-up that I have a thing for torture and pain. And at this point, there can be no argument that I might ever do anything BDSM as an act of love. At best, I‚Äôd do it as an act of self-pleasure because I so lack love--although even if someone would want to do it with me, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even be able to. I‚Äôve had rapid bursts of sexual urges followed by long (multi-day) periods of not having the slightest feeling of wanting to relieve myself since this break started. I‚Äôm sure that any girl with enough sex-drive to even tolerate BDSM would want it several times a day. So I wouldn‚Äôt even satisfy such a girl.

And, despite the above, I believe in God. I don‚Äôt want to do anything outside of marriage, which further proves my fucked-upness. Besides the fact that, even from a secular point-of-view, I‚Äôm fucked-up, I now am doubly so fucked-up from a Christian perspective. And all happiness is supposed to come from God. So I guess I‚Äôm so fucked-up that not even God wants to make me happy or something. I guess He wants to emphasize how much of a misbegotten shit I am.

As someone of illegitimate birth--as someone who could have been slaughtered just as easily as adopted--I am against the notion of abortion. In all ways, I am against it; even in cases of rape. I believe in the forgiveness of others (and yet I wonder whether I, too, will be forgiven?) because I find abortion to be punishment against a child for the sins of its parents. Someone who could have become a very close friend to me has just blocked me on Facebook because of my stance. I guess, besides not being good enough for Ivy League nor for affordable college nor for kindness from my father nor for happiness from God, I‚Äôm also not good enough even for friends. Literally everyone who likes me doesn‚Äôt know me whatsoever. Anyone whom I ever hang out with starts to drift away from me after maybe two hang-out-sessions. And I‚Äôm heavily introverted: I don‚Äôt just ‚Äúlook for new friends‚Äù like that--but besides that it‚Äôs socially uncomfortable for me to seek others in such a manner, it‚Äôs also futile. I am unloved and have almost zero confidence that I will ever be loved--especially not by myself.

The worst part of this all is that a hobby of mine is composing and playing music. At the absolute maximum, I‚Äôve done that for perhaps three hours out of three weeks. (And I feel as though it would be the same even if my dad would let me do whatever I wanted.) If I weren‚Äôt such a disappointment and a mistake, I would easily do it for six hours every day...but, alas, I am a mistake. So I haven‚Äôt even been doing the things I like to do...

And at this point, after much reflection on how bad of a person I am, I'm not sure whether I'll be happy again. I‚Äôm not asking for help, though. I just wanted to...You know what? I don‚Äôt even know why I wrote this, nor why I bothered to. I don‚Äôt care about support. Love doesn‚Äôt exist in my life like it does in others‚Äô. I don‚Äôt even care about getting it off my chest. I just felt like having my voice heard, perhaps.

"Since I finished high school like 4 years ago my sleep is seriously fucked up, I just can't fall asleep before 5-6am and then it's extremely difficult to wake up and get out of bed before 3-6 p.m. I am sleeping between 12-15 hours a day. Since summer I am on ADHD medication, Trintellix, and some sleeping aid plus I am trying to limit my caffeine input. The medication helped but not a lot.

When I sleep for 8 hours I just feel tired, if I don't have something obligatory to do I cant get out of bed, I tried a lot of things multiple alarm clocks, have my mom call me nothing, etc. I just want to sleep for 8 hours like a normal person and feel refreshed.

"I made posts about me not wanting to go to school, but I grew lady balls and put on my happy mask and went. 

just a side note that during the break I decided I was tired of feeling the way I‚Äôve been feeling the whole school year and to deal with my insecurities. I have a big fear of being alone and i tend to depend my happiness on people. So to start I cut toxic people off and limited my phone use. I got off my other friends backs and continued to develop a friendship that‚Äôs been blooming. I already start to feel better about myself.

So I quit a sport and I lost friends. I was so upset because I was alone again and started to resent other people that seemingly had a better life. But I realized I shouldn‚Äôt beg people to stay in my life and if they want to leave they can. Plus everybody isn‚Äôt perfect, and the comparing yourself to others just makes you more unhappy with yourself. People come in and out of your life as well, because everyone has their own life to live ya know? 

But anyway I got switched to new class today and it turned out I know everyone that sits at my table from past school years. I was so happy to be presented with the opportunity to make new friendships. Lunch kind of sucked bc I cut one girl off and she didn‚Äôt sit with me but I discovered another developing friendship switched classes and had the same lunch. Lucky me! 

In the morning I used to freak out because I had no place or group to sit with due to the sport being early in the morning. So I decided to deal with it and sat by myself in the library until 1st period started. It helped me realize that my social anxiety is just me and nobody really gives af if you are by yourself minding your business. Same with other class periods where I don‚Äôt have close enough friends. 

On top of this, I got my work schedule and I‚Äôm working a lot this week so I can stay busy. It‚Äôs like my life is getting back together and I‚Äôm trying to stay as positive as possible. I just wanted people to see especially if you‚Äôre in high school that school isn‚Äôt the devil you see it to be. 

I‚Äôm thankful for this sub and for the redditors that have given me advice. I realize that everyone has ups and downs, nobody is perfect and everyone has insecurities.

"This is my first post to a subreddit so forgive me if I fuck something up. I am going to keep personal info vauge incase someone I know ends up here. So here it goes. From a young age I always knew I had things worse when compared to others around me whether it be financial situation or relationships but in the past couple of years I really found how different I was. My dad was abusive to my mother, they split when I was 2 however I do know my father but he isn't a father in the traditional sense. I randomly see him every few years and I am like ""Oh hi dad"" then he is like ""hi son"" and boom, that's it fast forward 4 years and rinse and repeat. I was never really fond of any of my family, I despise one of my siblings  because he is a fucking scumbag and really dislike my mother because of her stupidity and ignorance and shitty attitude toward me. I have a meh relationship with the rest of my family. When I younger I was really interested in video games, I never had any friends, not a single one, due to lack of similar interests and the location of where I live. Fast forward years later and my situation has only changed negatively, from the years of being locked away in my room, I have developed extreme social anxiety (not officially diagnosed but I know the symptoms when I see them) and have only fallen into a deep state of sadness, dunno if it is depression. My social anxiety is horrible, I shit myself when needing to get a haircut or go to a store. My school is bad too, I talk to people but they are not my friends, I pretend they are so I don't look like a complete fucking loner. I have never had a girlfriend or kissed a girl either and I am not even a bad looking guy.  My only actual friend is someone I met on a game 4 years ago. We talk everyday. Which is even more sad. I am beyond petrified of turning 18, because once I do, my mother will make me get a job, or I will live on the streets. I am scared to get a buy something in a store, how the fuck am I getting a job. Just the pass summer, I didn't leave my house once, there was no reason to, I have no friends to go out to. I stayed in my house for 3 months and never left once. My current situation is I stay in my room wasting away with every passing day. And I only become more and more sad as the days go by. About a year ago I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am going to end my life before I turn 18. I feel no reason to live on, I will not fair well in adult hood anyway. I know a lot of people are just going to pass this off as another bullshit post where the author dosent actually die and lives on happily ever after, this isn't that story. I will be dead within a year, period. Nothing will change my decision to end my life. I plan to hang myself with a belt that will be wedged between my door. I will not leave a note, I wouldn't give my mother the pleasure of reassurance to why I did it,  she dosent deserve it. These aren't my only reasons why I want to die. One small one would be the fact that baldness is big in my family history, so even if I get my stuff figured out, I still have balding to look forward to. A big reason as to why I am going to end my life is the curiosity of an after life, I am not religious so I don't beileve in anything specific, but god damn I am jelous of the dead, they know what comes next. Worst case scenario, its nothingness which still sounds better than my life.

I'm a 20-something artist who just started an underpaid job at an animation company. It's only been 3 months and I already feel like a talentless hack. I don't even know how I managed to get this job. I don't even have a solid showreel and I don't have the time to build one. I honestly feel like shit about it. I cannot even enjoy making art at home anymore. I need help.

4 years of college was a waste. My college was shit, they didn't teach much for the amount of money my parents helped pay and sometimes I regret not quitting sooner but it's because of that place that I found the person I really like and look up to. They're a great animator and I wish to follow their path if I could. They don't know it but they're a great inspiration.

I've been crying for days and I can't focus on my work. I wish I could just quit but that's not a really good option for personal reasons.

I wish. Someone out there could teach me animation, 3D especially. I'm so desperate. I don't have the money to pay for online schools and I've had no luck finding good tutorials for everything I need to know to really get into this industry.

Right now I'm doing 2D animation but I want to move to 3D after this job. I know how to use the basics of Maya so that's not a problem. But I feel stuck. Paralyzed. I'm scared I can't make it alone. I don't even know if it's possible to transition just like that.

This post is going all over the place right now but I really needed to let it out and get help if I could. And no, I don't see a doctor to see if I have mental health problems or not. I don't talk to my parents about this either because they are conservative and religious (Not telling what religion) and let's just say I'm not ready to tell them I might have mental health issues.

"Hello :)

I want to make this short. I was never diagnosed with depression, though my mum, ex-girlfriend and best friend who lived with me told me, that they assumed I was depressed. Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life.

I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself.

I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically.

So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

What helped you? How did you manage to achieve this initial burst of action?

Thank you so much! Every response will help me tremendously!",2,just wasting time on the internet to distract myself

Hello,

I'm sorry I don't speak *my language* well, so i'm writing this in English. My name is --------- ------, but you can just call me ----. I'm 18 years old and I am ---- ------, I was born and raised here in -------. I'm just a student at an international school really. Things aren't working well, they've never worked well. For years and years of my life I've lived with thoughts of falling to my death, drowning in my own blood. Years and years of depression that was neglected. And now it has come to the point where I no longer am stable, I can't bear it. I am in so much pain. I hear voices sometimes, they tell me to kill myself and they laugh at me. The depression became so much more worse, with constant thoughts of dying, my meaning of life being nothing, everything equaling up to nothing. I have lived with an abusive father my own life and my mother, grandparents, sisters, relatives, and even myself have acted like nothing has happened for so many years. It was years of being traumatized that I didn't realize had affected me so bad. This morning, I didn't want to join him for an appointment as it would be expensive for both of us and he should only do his checkup for now. I had talked to my father in a calm voice, using ""please"" and ""I would really not like to"". He then proceeds to shout at the top of his lungs as if he were a lion, it is quite a shocking and traumatizing roar. Then he proceeds to punch me until I fall to the floor and he kicks me and punches me while I am in a fetal position. He then got a big jug of water to dump on my face which I was choking on because I was already screaming for help and choking on my words before that. I lay on the floor crying and screaming and begging anyone to help me. I live on the 18th floor of my condo so no one could. I tried to though. He physically abuses me often, and after it he cries and begs me for forgiveness. I cannot take it anymore. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my younger sister whom I love so dearly. I think I've lost my sanity at this point, I have no hesitation to harm myself and I leave the house at 3am and go for long walks and come at 7 or 8 am. That I've stopped just for my mother because it frightens her. She as well who keeps accusing me of being a whore because I go out on my own all the time and where clothing that shows off cleavage and also have a curvy figure.(I have large breasts so it's hard to find a shirt that isn't a turtleneck to hide anything decently) Those walks were the only source of happiness I had because the feeling of walking away from my home was magical, and now I don't recognize the feeling of happiness. (It's quite ironic since my name means Happiness in Hindi) Please help me. Or at least give me some answers, some information. Please let me talk to someone from your association. I am begging you, I need this help. I need to tell you more. I have some money with me, I can give it. You can do tests on me even, please just talk to me. I have a high IQ, and am about to major in psychiatry myself. Please contact me here or my number is **********. 

Regards,
**** ******

I know I was coming off desperate at the end but I am. I'm severely depressed but I don't want to be! I don't want to be like this anymore. It's been too many years of this abuse and I cannot bear it with how bad the depression has deteriorated my brain. If anyone wants to talk about this more, please feel free to dm me. I am on another account then my main one cause I don't want anyone recognizing me or friends knowing I posted this.

"I just want to start this off by saying that I've never felt better than I do now. In the past few years I've dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one. I've struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life and therefore never put any effort into anything I've done.

I've been on and off three depression medications in the past and now I just recently started my third. I truly can't tell a difference when I'm on or off the medication. I don't know if I have depression or just a lack of motivation to do anything. I don't know what's wrong with me, or if there's even a depression medication that can help me.

My psychiatrist visits last about 5-10 minutes with her prescribing me a medication and sending me on my way. My parents really dislike her because of her medication strategy, but she's the only one in my area for 300 miles. With all that being said, She prescribed me dextroamphetamine 3 months ago alongside my depression medication and I was able to close out this college semester with a 4.0, I've been able to wake up for work everyday at 4 AM and work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day for the past 2 weeks while on break and I'm taking care of myself better than I ever have before.

I feel so good, but I'm worried. I'm losing track of the pills of dextroamphetamine I'm using a day. I have to down 5 pills of melatonin a night to get sleep, I have to down 4 pills of ibuprofen every morning because I've been working my body so hard. I down 6 pills of dextroamphetamine throughout the day to keep my energy up and enjoy being at work. I'm going to become addicted, I'm going to build up too much tolerance, I won't be like this for very much longer and I'm worried. I wish I could feel energized all the time, why do I have to use medication to function. I wish I wasn't so lonely that I have to open up to reddit because I have nobody else. Why can't I be normal. Why did I even bother typing this. Why am I looking for acceptance right now. I don't even know how many pills I'm downing in a day just to accomplish a regular work day that everyone else can do normally. The answer is that it's too much.",2,"dropped out of high school, managed to find an alternative way to graduate, and then pass a semester of college to drop out of the next one,struggled with finding the purpose of everything my entire life, put any effort into anything I've done"
"Back in October I lost my job. I was a temp at a college and my boss didn‚Äôt know there was a limit on the length of a temp contract. The thing is, she had been doing kind of shitty things and when I finally held firm on my personal boundaries- boom. Come to work, worked for 2 hours, told to pack up. I kept my cool, but when I asked if I could use my boss as a reference she said ‚Äúwe can talk about that later.‚Äù I‚Äôve been seeing a therapist since the day I stood up for myself, just before they let me go though. The therapist is great and I understand that my old boss was manipulative, unfair, and just a shitty person. Still, as the sole breadwinner for my husband and kids I felt like I had been punched in the gut and the feeling hasn‚Äôt really gone away yet. 

My husband is going back to school and also takes care of our 2 girls ages 2.5 and 5 years. He is getting better at being supportive but is pretty much the most unemotional person I‚Äôve ever met. He doesn‚Äôt understand that my depression is not a choice. Why on earth would anyone want to feel this way? My psychiatrist and therapist keep emphasizing that I practice self care and give myself space but whenever I ask if I can just be alone for a bit, or go out with friends, my husband acts resentful. 

In late November I started a new temporary position whoch should go through March, and all I do is go to work, come home to a crazy house (we also live with my loud, dumb, &amp; chatty af mother-in-law) and then go to bed when the kids finally concede. I feel fine at work, almost good sometimes, but as soon as I come home I feel totally overwhelmed. I have few escapes and I find myself wishing I could disappear from the world and that my family would magically forget me so that they wouldn‚Äôt be hurt and I wouldn‚Äôt scar my kids for life. 

Tonight I brought up taking a class I really want to take two nights a week, which would mean I wouldn‚Äôt get home until after the kids are asleep, and one of those nights my MIL or my parents would need to watch the girls for a few hours. My husband‚Äôs reaction was basically through gritted teeth ‚Äúit would make a lot of things unnecessarily hard, but if you feel like it‚Äôs what you need to do...‚Äù

So the words were ok, but the way they were said changed the message entirely. Like I said, he doesn‚Äôt have/process emotions well so I‚Äôm trying to tell myself that he just isn‚Äôt aware that his resentment seeps into things all the time and ruins them. Straightforward- ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too much,‚Äù compromising- ‚Äú how can we work around the schedule conflict?‚Äù Or ACTUAL support- ‚ÄúI know you need to something for yourself.‚Äù Would all be fine, but saying something vaguely supportive with a hostile attitude feels manipulative. I keep wishing I could just go to my mom‚Äôs house for the first time in my adult life because there even though my parents are weird they also can just be straightforward or supportive without emotional strings.

So tonight I went into my space-out mode after the class conversation, which then turned to silent sobbing. Couldn‚Äôt read to my kids because I was crying and they couldn‚Äôt understand me, couldn‚Äôt do anything. Husband just sat around with me and the kids, never asked if I needed something, or wanted to be alone for a bit. No acknowledgement whatsoever about the fact that for over an hour I sobbed while it upset my kids. The lack of response is almost worse than the conflicted responses, but both leave me feeling utterly alone and wanting to die. There. I fucking said it.

So here I am. On Reddit. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone actually reading this, and the truth is what difference would it make? If you are reading this, thank you. I hope that you are coping with your challenges better than I am, and that you have someone who can support you in the ways you need.

Now that I've finally done it I do not feel any less empty. I do not hate myself less. I still feel hatred towards myself and old doubts have been replaced with new ones. I do not get how I can go on if this is all that is going to happen. If I keep achieving things and I still have so many doubts that weigh me down or ones that leave me empty then what is the purpose of going on if you are always going to fail in some way. 

I used to also think that if I ever met anyone special that I would develop some confidence, but  if I didn't get any after this goal then how will a romantic relationship help me?

"I **need** this year to be better.

I'm nearing the end of my third year of college. The new semester is approaching quickly, and I desperately need a good one in order to save me from failing.

I failed two courses last semester. I was miserably depressed the whole time and it showed on my GPA. That was my free pass; I can't afford to fail any more. If I do, I won't graduate on time. If I don't graduate on time, I don't graduate at all because they'll cut $8000 of financial aid and I can't magically come up with that money myself.

But this year doesn't have to be like that. I don't believe all of the bullshit about how the new year promises change and hope. It's literally just another day, except the year is different. Still, I'm mildly optimistic. 

I've never been a hard worker, but that has to change now. I know exactly what I have to do to be a successful student; doing it is just impossible sometimes. 

My depression is like a roller coaster. Before Christmas I felt amazing, and now I feel empty and broken inside. That worries me: if it comes back in full force in the middle of the semester, that could cause a great deal of damage.

Regardless, I wish you all a great new year. Hopefully this one won't be quite as shitty.",2,"I failed two courses last semester, if I donít graduate they will cut financial assistance"

My mom wanted to know my shedule for next week, and I showed her that it was empty, meaning they fired me, but I didn't tell her that and she thought they were just giving me the week off, which is an impossibility in retail. 

I start college in two weeks, and now I won't have a paycheck coming every week, but I can't bring myself to care all that much. I noticed I've been much more reckless when driving by myself lately, too. I almost got T boned after leaving the library yesterday and felt nothing. No fear. Just nothing. 

I wish I could work at the library, it's usually quiet around there...

"27 years old, short (168 cm), no job, no girlfriend, no friends, no future.

 Earlier in life I was an idiot and didn't get any useful degree (even though I had an opportunity at the time) and got a stupid manager education instead just because it was easier. After that never worked as a manager cause I don't like people so of course I hated the job. Was working some random jobs which I hated aswell. 

 One day I decided to quit, move to the big city and get a decent degree in something. Figured I like computers so I'm gonna go ahead and be a computer guy. Got into the university for evening classes but couldn't even finish the first semester cause I was unable to find a decent day job to pay for this education so I got really sad and couldn't focus on the classes, plus I realized that this profession is way too hard for me.

  Years ago got alienated from a few friends I had cause coulnd't stand being a looser in front of them. Never had a proper sexual relationships cause on top of everything I'm a premature ejaculator so I guess it psychologically distanced me from getting intimate with girls. Got a decent body and in a good shape but to maintain it I have to work out regularly and eat crazy amounts of food in order to not become a scrawny ass motherfucker I was in high school. 

So here I am. Almost 30 and have nothing and no one except my mom. And it numbs me. Paralyzes me every second of my life. I can't even enjoy a movie now. Can't watch how all these tall men on the screen live their beatiful and interesting lives without hating myself for my life choices. So I just stuck in my apartment playing videogames all day to silence the pain while mother paying my bills. Nothing interests me anymore. Nothing brings joy. All I wanna do is to die.

Does anyone else feel this way? When I'm at work I can't wait to get out and relax and not have to deal with the stress. But when I'm not at work I feel incredibly lonely and depressed and can't wait to get back to work to keep my mind off of things. I'm afraid to move out of my parents house because I feel I will be a miserable wreck on my own. I won't even have the comfort of my own family to come home to.

"I have several problems. One of them is that I'm 52 years old and don't have a job currently. I've tried searching for jobs and applying but I can't find any.

Roughly a week and a half ago, I broke my ankle while out taking pictures at a local nature preserve. I tripped over a low-cut tree stump that was hidden under the falling fresh white snow. I was rushed to the hospital ER and operated on the following day where the put 2 plates and some pins in my ankle. A few days after that, I was sent to a local old-age home in my hometown to finish my rehab. I've been stuck here doing rehab ever since. My first appt. with the foot dr isnt for a week and then I'll know how everything is going.

I feel very frustrated being in this place and it drives me insane. Luckily I have a private room (it's semi-private but nobody is in the room with me) and they allow me to keep my door shut all the time. I have trouble with sleeping and they give me NYQUIL at night to help calm me down. 

Personally I would like to leave tonight but I have a ""non weight-bearing"" status on my foot and can't do anything at home yet. I'm learning to hop around on one foot and use a walker and everything but it is taking a lot of time. I'm very impatient sitting in this home though and wish I could do something (or my dad would do something) to get me to come home however since he's 80, he wants me to stay in here for a while to get better as well.

I constantly feel as though my life is worthless and this tragedy is just the latest in a long long line. I'm not sure how I can get my life back on track and I've talked to a counselor before for several sessions but really haven't come up with much in terms of solutions. Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated...

But here's the thing. He's the one who found the course and told me to go and do it. I was so ready for the job and I feel so frustrated that I did the course for basically no good reason.

This year has been nothing but negativity for me, not just because of all the negativity the media has been flaunting around in our faces about the horrible celebrity deaths, but because of my three deaths in my family. All of which I was extremely close to.

I feel like an outcast at my job and pretty much anywhere else I go but I act as normal as you could define anyone as ""normal"" would act. I try to treat anyone I come across with nothing but kindness and hate to see someone get mistreated.

But seriously, to continue with my sloppily organized post about how this negativity is ruining my life, I don't have my life even 1% figured out. I'm 21 which is a young age to have anything at all figured out but as I look around all I see are my friends getting engaged or getting these big job offers that they've always dreamed of. Some of them are also getting excepted into their dream schools to do what they've always dreamed of. One of my used to be closest friends got accepted into a school in Atlanta that will score him a place in TNA which will therefore most likely lead him into WWE. Yeah yeah it's fake and blah blah blah but it's what he wants to do and I've been supportive of him. I work at Lowe's, it's a very loving job and I love the people I work with most of the time, I don't feel like it's enough though. I don't feel like I living up to what I can be, but I don't know what I can/should be doing. Not a damn clue.

I've spent most of my last 6 months alone ever since my aunt died. I'm just very unsocial and it's extremely difficult for me to make new friends. I'm also not one to go and party (alcohol, weed, etc) because it's just not me. Everyone around me is that way and they're even getting into harder drugs. Yes this is the people I work with. My past relationships have both ended because of them cheating on me. I just don't really know what's wrong with me or if I push people away from me for a reason?

What I'm trying to say is that as I look at my friends having a blast on new years eve/day with their families, I sit here with tears in my eyes because I feel like I have no one. I feel very unloved and very unwanted. I just feel like that 2017 is going to be a long year spent as a loner because I just don't appeal to anyone and I don't have anyone to go out and do anything with to meet more people. I don't finwant to invite myself into peoples' plans and I don't want to invite them to do anything because rejection is pretty common for me. I trapped in a very dark place and finding the light seems impossible for me. Someone please help me.

"I'm just a complete mess, and when she wants to go out and spend time with people, I enjoy that to a point, but then it becomes immensely stressful. And I've gone through a really difficult time, Christmas, New Years and 3 birthdays are in the space of a week. I've finished my uni and gone through a car accident in the past 2 weeks. I haven't been earning income from welfare since November so I'm really quite poor.

And I just don't have any way to vent and last night, when new years plans went to hell and my license disappeared, I snapped. I broke as a person. And I tried to be okay and I couldn't be.

"I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. 

Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. 

My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 

2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already.

"(This is a comment I posted yesterday that kind of explains my life right now and I was hoping maybe if I post it here I can just talk to someone about it.)

I just want my life to feel worth living honestly. 

I'm embarrassed by my body so I'm trying to gain weight and move my 150lbs to 180lbs to gain a little bit REAL confidence so I dont have to fake it all the time. I've got a healthy diet and workout routine going, but until I'm at my desired weight I just feel weak and unattractive all the time.

I just graduated highschool early 2016 and have decided to not go to college. It was four years worth of time in making that choice and weighing my options, now I made the choice and am wondering if I chose wrong. My business is going no where and I am running low on the little funds I have left. I can see my parents empathy for the unemployed graduate is starting to run a little thin too.

On average I wake up depressed 5/7 days of the week and go to sleep every single night wondering where my life is going and how I can manage to reach my goals and dreams. Happiness comes and goes, but 9 times out of 10 I'm just putting on a show. Nothing I'm not familiar with though. That's what my whole fucking life has been. A damn show. Now I'm not saying I've had it bad. My family is kind and loving. And I grew up relatively middle class. What I am saying is that as soon as I started highschool my life became fake. I put on this character so people will think I'm okay when I'm really not. 

I lie to my family and tell them that everything is going fine and that ""Business is great! I'm not depressed at all! Wow yesterday was so much fun sitting at home all alone with no one to talk to and only my thoughts to remind me of how much of a failure I've been recently!"" I'm too damn proud to admit that I have no clue what I'm doing and the last thing I want them to do is worry. Not like it matters anyways. My dad can see my bank account slowly dropping day by day. I tell him I have funds in my paypal, but I'm not sure if he believes that anymore.

Everyone knows I'm failing at life right now too. Whenever someone asks about my job my parents and friends never say that I'm a photographer, or a video editor, or a writer, or a musician. It's always ""well he's just taking some time off right now."" Or ""yeah he's unemployed."" Or ""He doesn't really do anything."" Or worst of all ""Oh he's just having fun messing around with a little photography."" Really? Messing around? So practicing my craft for 6 years and now trying to run a business is just messing around. Well shit I guess they're right. It's not like I'm making any damn money doing this anyways. Today I officially shut it down. Everyone seems to think that all it is is a hobby so maybe that's how I should keep it. I just applied for a few shitty, monotonous 9-5s, the things I told myself I would never do and I feel like I sold out all my values. I've given up everything I stand for and I've given up on myself. I highly doubt I'll even get the jobs anyways. No one wants to hire someone with past experience as ""summer lifeguard"" and ""photographer"".

Stress eats away at my health constantly. If depression isnt causing me to oversleep and then not even feel restes than stress is keeping me awake. I'm eighteen fucking years old. Eighteen. You wanna know what my blood pressure was on the last time I checked? 141/90. I eat relatively healthy, and try to exercise daily and my blood pressure is 141/90.

And don't get me started on dating. Oh damn am I fucked up. Aside from the fact that I have these unrealistic standards for girls I can't even get in a relationship. I've been in four relationships in my life so far right? Girl #1 broke up with me (she ended up figuring out she was a lesbian so kudos to her and no hard feelings on this one). #2 three months, cheated. #3 seven months, cheated. Took her back, cheated again. #4 same shit as #3. I went to one highschool dance. My senior prom. The minute we walked in she said bye and walked off with some other dude to dance. Now I've got these trust issues and on top of that I only chase unhealthy relationships. I get so close to a relationship with someone good then just lose interest because now it's not a chase anymore. What the hell is wrong with me?!

I thought that I could prove people wrong. I thought that maybe they weren't right. Maybe I'm not some fucking loser with no talents. Maybe my dreams aren't stupid and unachievable. Maybe once I graduate, I can show everyone that doubted me that I actually can do it and prove to everyone that following your dreams is an option! Well maybe in reality, that's just something you tell the stupid little kid who thinks he can be whatever he wants so he'll just shut up and leave you alone. 

I'm tired of people lying to me and saying ""You can do it! Don't give up! Dreams do come true!"" I've been putting in the work and got shit. Countless days and nights of no sleep trying to find that next job or making that project perfect. Dreams are just that. Fucking dreams, and that's where they need to stay. The only reason people think they can do anything is because they see a select few people that happened to be at the right place at the right time for a payoff. It doesn't matter if you've worked your ass off or if you just started yesterday, because in the end, all that matters is if you were lucky enough to roll the dice on the time they decided to land in your favor.

Everyday I wake up, put on this 'mask' and make people think I'm happy so that maybe they can trick me into thinking I'm happy too. The problem is now, is that it's not working anymore.

To top it all off, I don't feel entitled or like I'm allowed to feel depressed. I'm not homeless, not raised in a bad situation, I'm white in America. I feel like if I tell anyone about this all I'm gonna get is a ""get over it"" kind of response.",2,"graduated high school, did not go to college, started with business, wonedring if imade worng choices, parents emapthy for unemployed graduate,consider photograpgy craft is a waste"

"Hello. So I would like to preface this by saying that I have not been formally diagnosed with depression, but I figured this subreddit would be the best place to seek advice nevertheless. I hope you don't mind me. 

For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. 

What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. 

Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind.

"This might end up sounding like a bunch of rambling but I am tired and have to get this off my chest to someone else. 

The last few months have been really rough. Between a very serious likelihood that I am going to have to drop out of grad school because of a stupid error on my part, money issues, and just struggling with Seasonal Affect Disorder, this is the lowest I have ever been. . 

Getting the ""blues"" during the winter time for me is normal and I usually don't say anything to anyone but this year has been so so bad. Up until now, I haven't seriously felt the ""Things would be better without me"" feeling before and it scared the shit out of. I was driving in car and I had a very real moment of not wanting to hit the brakes as I pulled up to the stop sign.. I am still scared about how bad I was feeling and could feel again. Honestly, on top of the fear and sadness, I feel a lot of shame for being so bummed out and having a thought like that. 

I struggled with whether or not to tell anyone. I was really ashamed with how I felt. I have a degree in Psych and I work in Mental Health so I have given the ""who to talk to/numbers to call"" speech more times than I can count but I was/am scared to admit that I might need it. It took me a couple of days but I did end up telling my boyfriend. I don't think that I can talk to my parents/family about how I am feeling yet. .Just a different type of relationship with them but I told him. It was incredibly scary and I don't think I have ever felt more ashamed/scared to say something in my life. I couldn't outright say that I wanted to die in that moment but I told him how I felt and he seemed to understand. He made sure to do the good boyfriend/person thing. . Was very understanding/supportive but made sure that I knew I needed to tell him or someone if I was that sad or felt that way again.

"Okay so this is extremely embarrassing and I have been called everything under the sun from lazy to useless, I have been out of full time employment since 2013 with only one seasonal summer job as a parts driver for a helicopter company last summer. 

In my previous work place which was known as a starter company for the trade I was trying to get into I worked myself into sickness and was bullied by grown ass men into depression. This all culminated into a bad back injury from lifting a 12x12 with a coworker when the coworker slipped and I tried to compensate which made me slip a disc. I was bullied into not filling for workers comp and put on light duty for 2 weeks, this all happened around the time I was finally supposed to get my apprenticeship. Instead I was laid off, to which no one told me until I drove the hour to work but everyone seemed to know the day before. 

So this is the embarrassing part, I had a mental breakdown in my truck then drove home crying. I was so frustrated so angry. I should have gone then and there to the competitor in town and applied for a job, but I couldn't bring myself to so I took a few days for myself and started applying for more entry level trade jobs. Now if you haven't been in or tried to get into a trade, most of the time the only way your going to even get a interview is if you know someone who works for the company. Which unfortunately I was 20 at the time and just starting out, so of course I didn't know anyone in the trade. And then whole oil glut/oligarchy thing happened which made it even harder. 

So I did that for a year, had to move back with my parents, my parents gave me shit when I tried to sell my truck  and they took on the payments. I shouldn't have let them I know, it made me feel so shitty and it still does. So then summer hits and my best friends family owns a helicopter company and this was a big fire year in my province, so he asked me if I could give him a hand so I did. I wish I could still work for them, I didn't think people could be so nice at a workplace. Then summer ended and  they didn't need me anymore, so I went back to looking. Then last winter I slipped and slipped my disc again only this time was much worse and I was laid up for 6 months doing pt, getting injections and seeing a chiropractor. 

Now I've been out of work with almost nothing to show for my time for so long and I have nothing to put on my resume. I did do a few courses to try and get something but that didn't pan out. I have my h2s, csts, first aid and forklift and zoomboom tickets. I just want to live, not exist. I need work, I've tried applying for everything under the sun the past few months. Every day gets harder and harder at this point I think I should just kill myself to relieve my parents of a financial burden , and a embarrassment. I feel like such a failure, I tried my hardest I really did I swear I'm not lazy I'm trying, please I just want to be a person again. 

If you read all that, thank your for taking the time to it really means a lot to me. It's hard for me to type this out and even harder for me to hit the post button. Sorry for getting pretty emotional towards the end and also for any grammatical errors English is my second language.

"Maybe this post belongs in r/anxiety; I'm not quite sure. I do know that lately I've had this feeling that, on several occasions, has made me quite literally sick to my stomach. It's very hard to describe.

See, I recently turned 18. I'm graduating high school a semester early with a fairly low GPA (2.7 weighted) despite my myriad veritable academic interests because I have this overwhelming boredom and this feeling that nothing is happening when I'm there. This nothingness has grown increasingly pervasive in my life.

I want to go to college but feel it is not in my best interest at the moment. I want to take a year off and work but am worried a year might turn into a lifetime of dead-end jobs and complacency. I want sometimes to pass my house in my Jeep and keep driving. But what would that solve?

I guess what I'm getting at is that I have no direction at the moment and nothing is calling me particularly loudly. I don't know where to go or what to do. I often find my eyes welling up and my fingers tapping my quivering leg with a sense of urgency, but alas I am still sitting. This yearning to do, to live, to experience coupled with my indistinct, unguided future, has birthed an uneasiness, a tension, that I haven't been able to relieve. 

Thank you for taking the time.

"Good day everyone!

I have decided to write my story here, since it seems that there might be some people here who might relate to me and maybe give insight.

TLDR: I am a 25 year old male who is enjoying his life, but constantly feels that he is doing more negative than positive things day-to-day in his life.

So going back to the story. As said above in the TLDR i have this weird feeling that i am doing more negative things in my life than positive things day-to-day and i can't seem to shake it off. Let me clarify that feeling, every day when i wake up i feel i am doing more things I DON'T WANT TO DO and LESS THINGS I WANT TO DO! No i am not depressed (at least i think i am not), no i am not sad, but this feeling makes me empty. It all started when i went to college for Bachelors degree. Before that everything seemed fine and i was doing more positive things in life than negative ones. My Bachelors degree went smoothly, i got the degree, i got a decent job (above average pay where i live), i wen't on to Masters degree and from the get go (starting from Bachelors degree) i have this urgency, that i do more things i don't want to do day-to-day and i get no pleasure from it.

Let me bring you an example. I wake up, i go to work. This part i enjoy. Now everything falls apart after work. I have to do this Masters degree and i feel like this is a complete and utter chore to do. Although everyone expect that i must finish this, so i have this pressure on me, that i have to finish this and i want to, but i feel like i am a prison in my own jail. I would gladly workout or hangout with friends, but i can't because from the morning to evening i am at work and after evening till night (sometimes even to 02:00 or 03:00) i do school stuff. I have already burned out once before (where i failed hard on some assignments) and i decided to take less workload. Still i feel like i am always overwhelmed and i can't seem to find free time to be who i want to be, but rather i feel like i have to complete these chores.

Then there is this another thing. I don't get enough respect from others although when problems arise, everyone are running to me for help. For an example, i am an engineer and the university where i am is expanding in the field where i work. I offered my help for anything the answer was ""You should get more experience before offering help"" from the director. After that i was quite confused, because i have been working on my speciality for over 3 years, i have a Bachelors degree, i am looking forward for my Masters degree and when i offer a friendly helping hand i get scolded for no apparent reason. Also when they need some materials from the workplace i work for, then everyone are running for me to ask help.

This helping is expanding to other things as well in life. When my friends are in need of help (lending money or anything else) then everyone are running to me, but i get no credit for it. For one friend i helped him to get a great job opening through my connections and then he was ""Yeah man, thanks for helping me, i will throw you a party"" of course this party never happened and i never got a thanks for it, rather that just thank you and goodbye.

Also at workplace i often get the same ""Disrespect"" treatment from older engineers (since i am a young guy) then i also provide new ideas, new innovative approaches and i seem to never get any respect for it. I have brought new ideas which have improved some systems and then its like ""Well its obvious thanks for the help"", but sometimes i get scolded for no apparent reason like the same from the director. Is this like some kind of an age thing? I don't understand or am i just an idiot.

But the main thing although is this school thing, that some of my classmates who are not even working in their speciality full-time are going more to school and getting more praises like scholarships, director is happy with them and me who is working as a full-time engineer, gets scolded, gets said like ""Get more experience"" although others who have never worked in their speciality. Is this like some kind of an academid circle-jerk they are doing to me? No i am not a fricking loser loner nerd guy, i am quite a self confident guy, but this just makes me so angry that i provide the university materials and experience from my workplace and i get scolded for working and not being full-time academic student? How does this even be logical?

Oeh there are many more things which i could write, but i don't want to drag this out if anyone has any questions or wants to discuss, i would happily open up more.

Thank you,
I just wanted to write this out!",2,"feeling more negative than positive, doing masters ,get no pleasure,"
"Welp, here I am.  I dropped out of one of the best colleges in the country last semester because I had no motivation and couldn't focus on schoolwork for the life of me.

I can feel my parents getting restless, and they keep asking me what my plan is and all I can say is ""I don't know yet"".

"A few months ago I was hired by a very well-known business. I had to leave my other job abruptly because this new job was paying my $15 an hour which is damn near double the amount I was making at my old job. 

I wanted to give my old job a two-weeks notice but I couldn't because the new job couldn't give me a proper state date then they finally told me it would be the following Monday which was three days later. It sucked but I had to tell my boss that I had to quit after the Saturday before. He knew that I was getting a new job so I didn't just spring this on him. I hated telling him I had to start on Monday.

Monday rolls around and the new job tells me they don't need me until a week later. I didn't have my old job to go back to since they had already taken me out of the system. So yay, I was screwed out of a weeks pay. 

I finally did get to work the following week. Now, I don't have a car of my own. New job said they would work with me and either pick me up from my home or have me walk a few blocks to be picked up. Since November I have only worked a total of two weeks. I don't have a car to just drive around and look for jobs nor do I have a friend that can drive me around (I don't even know what a friend is anymore). 

New job hasn't had any work for me for the past two weeks and they are saying they are keeping us till the 13th. I have a phone bill I have to pay in a few weeks plus give my roommate rent. He also works for new job and is also having a hard time as well since he has no car.

I simply do not have the money to buy a car or even a down payment. I wish I knew what to do or where to go. I can't help but once again think about the life I had before last June. I had a family, a car and a wife. I still have a bit of resentment towards her because when she left me she want to her parents and they immediately helped her get a car. We lost our old car because we were behind on payments and I was borrowing a car from a friend of her family until she left then they guy suddenly needed it back...

I'm just super worried about everything. I don't have a single way out of this house. I feel like this is my prison. I'm here with roommates who all they want to do is get high (I have no problems with smoking by the way) and play video games. I enjoy gaming myself, but I don't want that to just be my life. I hate it here. I wish I knew of something to do or where to go. I wish a someone would talk to me or listen. I wish someone was concerned about my life. I miss having friends who cared.

"I've hated school all my life, but I did my best to get good grades and finish because I thought I could finally be free once I graduate. After graduating, I thought life would finally start being fun and enjoyable, I had worked so hard to finally be over with it and I was full of dreams and motivation. Fast forward 2 years later, I tried everything I could, from starting my own business to working at a restaurant, working in software development job (I graduated in Computer Science), working as a guide, acting, and every time it's the same, I end up hating my job and my life and quit. At this point I feel like I've lost all my motivation to do anything, I don't know what I want to do and no matter how much I look for a passion I can't find one. I'm currently employed and I hate my job, just thinking about it makes me want to kill myself. Everybody thinks I'm doing great because I go to the gym, learn foreign languages, play music, got good grades at school, but work makes me so fucking depressed that all I can think of is ending everything. I love to learn languages but that doesn't make any money, translation makes money but I hate it and want to kill myself just thinking about it. I love watching anime, listening to music, playing music, eating good food, seeing a nice scenery, but none of that makes money, and with no money I'm homeless, and I'd rather die than be homeless, but working makes me want to kill myself. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, I have a good family who I most definitely do not want to harm and thus suicide is absolutely out of the question, I could never forgive myself if I went through with it. So here I am, hating my life and wanting to kill myself every day but unable to do so because I do not want to cause harm to my family. It's like I'm in jail although I'm perfectly healthy (at least physically) and free (in theory). I just wish I was never born, I wouldn't be in this situation and everything would be so much easier.

"Hi everyone,
I've been lurking on this reddit for a couple of months now, on and off, depending on my mood. It's always been uplifting to read the responses to the posts.

The context of my problem is that I'll be looking for an internship in April of this year (my very first job), and I'm unsure if I can match up to the competition and impress a potential employer.

However, that isn't what I wanted help with. My problem is that when I think about my prospects, I have attacks of what I'm pretty sure is called ""anticipatory"" anxiety, ranging from vague feelings of discomfort to hyperventilating panic attacks, almost always followed by a period of intense depressed lethargy where I am unable to do anything but stare at the ceiling and feel shitty about myself. This can last for anytime between 2-3 hours to a whole day.

Needless to say, this is seriously hampering my productivity, and I'd like to ask about the r/depression community if they've ever experienced anything similar and what they've done to avoid or subdue these feelings of hopelessness and anxiety.

Thanks in advance!

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5jquj6/i_failed_another_college_class_and_i_dont_know/

But basically I am 23 years old and a computer science major and I have recently just failed another semester of college and told my mother about it. She was disappointed in me and really expressed her disappointment in me.

Whenever I don't distract myself with video games or watching tv I feel miserable about my life and reflect about how much of a failure I think I am. I usually get thoughts about what I would've done differently if I could turn back time and get a sort of existential crisis. 

Sometimes I feel motivated in the morning to improve my life and that I would build up on my resume by trying to learn a new programming language or by working on an app or some coding project I can put on my portfolio but whenever I get stuck I end up losing my will to continue and go back to having my existential crisis.

I have tried following a daily schedule and deleting the games I play on my computer but I end up still distracting myself with other things.

Is there a way to just power through life? I keep telling myself that life gets better and that in the future I'll get married and start my own family and will be happy. But whenever I take some time to think about it I don't really know if its worth it. 

Thanks for reading.",2,"failed another semester, mother disappointed in me, distract self with video games, lack of motivation, existential crisis"

"I've had literal months to finish these two assignments for college (UK college, I'm 17, doing a fashion design course) and I've barely started due to a mixture of depressed feelings and fear of getting the work wrong and being thought of as an idiot. I was given an extension for one of them which was due before the christmas holidays but my tutor gave me until we go back for the new term, which is tomorrow. I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks. Maybe its because I'm falling behind in my work, but all I want to do is kill myself most of the time and that's not an exaggeration at all. 

I have two assignments due tomorrow, one that I've had an extension on already for the same reason, and I have to go in and explain why I haven't completed it again. I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course?

"I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company.

I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period.

I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it.

Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort.

When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours.

I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain.

I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then.

Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.

"So, I have really bad emetophobia. That means I have a fear of vomit. ¬†I have horrible dreams about vomit every night. Last night I had the worst vomit dream yet about my brother vomiting and it was so traumatic that it is really sticking with me today, I couldn't shake the horrible feelings. I found out after I woke up that he is actually sick and has been vomiting. But I have to go to an orchestra thing with him and my family tonight. I was obviously worried about it and my mom got upset about it and told me not to ruin the family's day. I really didn't know what to do because I had been on the edge of crying all day. I feel like my family thinks I am selfish for¬† expressing my anxiety about this and I feel shame. At the concert it was fine and I was coping. But after the concert, my brother said he felt sick and thaf made me really anxious. I kept walking so I was away from him, preferably ahead. We went down a bunch of stairs and my anxiety grew. We went in an open area and I was so terrified that I would see him do the thing that I started to tear up. By the time we got outside I was crying silently to myself. The whole way to the car I was behind everybody so nobody knew I was crying harder and harder thinking about what I could do to avoid getting in a car with him, but thinking that my parents would get mad and think I'm ridiculous. When we got there we were about to get in an elevator and I was hyperventilating to the point that they looked. They went up the elevator and Mystica came with me while I almost collapsed on the stairwell. I literally was gasping so much I couldn't breathe. My mom came down the stairs and asked me if this was because I thought Michael would vom. I said yes. She said I need to pull my act together, that she doesn't want me to ruin their night,¬† she wanted it to be a happy night. She told me that he hasn't vomited yet so I shouldn't be like this. She said I need to pull it together. This was all in a raised voice and I could tell she was mad. 

This hurt me and invalidated me so, so much. I stared blankly the ride home and then I texted her pouring my heart out about how hurt I am. She still didn't really seem to care. 

I'm honestly a little bit surprised because I didn't think it was possible to feel so fucking isolated. I didn't think she would do something this bad. I left and slept at somebody else's house. I feel so horrible and worthless.

"I guess I'm looking for 3rd party opinions and maybe a little support if anyone else is in the same predicament. TMS has been the only thing to work for me, but its efficacy might be fleeting and insurance doesn't approve maintenance. I had a late response to the initial TMS series and they denied me for 10 more sessions; I wrote them a fairly scathing appeal letter and ended up winning; I used to be a writer at least in mind. I never had any accolades but I liked what I wrote and wrote a lot. So I let them have it in the letter and got the 10 extra sessions but everything is still uncertain long term.

So now my doctor drops the bomb that after this, ECT is pretty much where we go from here if the TMS doesn't hold. I'm 25, and I'm worried both about destroying my brain with treatment as well as allowing this disorder to keep me from really doing or acheiving anything in what will amount to a short, unnecessarily painful life. 

Is there another place people go from here? Do you just get real into Buddhism or stoicism or some shit and white-knuckle it? I always feel like there's something I have to be missing, and yet... 

I almost feel bad relating my story at this stage, as I'm pretty sure I'm doing all the things one is supposed to do, and yet recovery feels as remote as ever. Even with ECT it's like, what's the fucking point, probably fry my brain for a 60% chance at remission, that may not hold either.

"I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. 

I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does.

The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me.

In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings.

Oh man, this is getting really long, looks like a story haha... But yeah, I‚Äôm bored, nothing seems to be fun anymore, I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything, but I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time, which feels bad... 

That‚Äôs how I feel, I think... So, I don‚Äôt know... I guess I‚Äôll have to pay $40 to my psychiatrist to get my medicine again so I don‚Äôt get suicidal thoughts again and I actually kill myself... Hope everyone‚Äôs having a good day I guess?

I started cutting my arm and all, hoping he'd get sympathetic and stay with me. I didn't care what the reason was. Love or whatever. I just wanted. Him. 

Things happened. And we broke up. I was with another guy. I thought that would just be a rebound thing but right now, almost three and a half years later, we're still going strong.

2.  Moving away for college. I thought that's just the change that I needed in life but I was wrong. I hated it there in college. It was so lonely. I had Friends. But no one to actually hang out with. I was alone. Wanting to go back home where everything was familiar. But that wasn't possible. I tried taking with my mom and dad. But they wouldn't listen. So I asked stuck. I wasn't doing good in class. I was trying. I got better in classes. But mentally iy was hard. 

Then came pleurisy. A lung condition. And a sudden attack of asthma. Pericarditis. And some other minor things. 
Sick and alone. I started getting bitter. Negativity surrounded Me. Life seemed useless. There was nothing to look forward to.  Nothing to live for. I had friends and family and a significant other who loved me a lot and I loved him back. But none of that seemed important enough to live for. 
I tried taking to him. Explaining why I was acting the way I was but I guess after sometime he got fed up. He understood me but not too well.  

To him it was like me making negativity and sadness a hobby. But that wasn't the case. He tried. He really tried all that he could. But I was in too deep. He told me to force myself to be happy, think happy and be happy, but it's not so easy you know?

You'll only know how it is if you feel it yourself. 
I was stuck. I started cutting my arm and taking high doses of whatever Med I could find and sleeping pills. I wanted to sleep forever. To die. I started planning and plotting the best ways to die painlessly.  I was a wimp, a pussy. I wanted to die but I was too chicken to actually do it. 
I walked out In the middle of the night multiple times wandering around aimlessly trying to clear my mind, to make a decision. It was useless. I wanted to walk up in front of a car or a bus and get hit and die. I tried that. I got scared and never succeeded.

"Hello..

I've been in a bad way for over 5 years as of today and tried almost every anti depressant but none of them help. I see a therapist and that helps a little having someone to talk to.. but doesn't really fix anything. 

I really try to be happy I exercise I got a job I was good at 

Well recently I got fired for ""Not being a good fit anymore"" or ""You seem really down and its bad in the work place"" 

I've turned to cocaine witch atleast makes me feel happy for 30 minutes before I feel like shit again 

I'm not a heavy user but it honestly seems like drugs are the only thing that really help and I know that sounds crazy.. 

My family has given up on my bullshit and I dont blame them I get really sad and upset over nothing and without a job I have just become a burden. 

I have tried to kill myself 2 times and I really reallly don't want to get to that point again but I just really need advice on what to do. 

I have stopped taking drugs for just over 3 months now to see if that was making it worse but it wasnt

"This past month has hit me like a freight train with red-hot spikes on the front. 

A while ago, I started hooking up with this guy. He's pretty cute, he's lively, outgoing, and funny. I started getting feelings for him, but I was afraid to tell him because I was afraid of getting hurt again. But life finds a way to hurt me anyways.

We hadn't talked in a while, and it made me feel like he was done with me. It sucked, but I knew it was going to happen eventually. Conveniently at this point, my ex hits me up. We start talking about how we're doing and politics (usually not good but we both enjoy talking about it), and then I noticed that he was getting....flirty?

Eventually he asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits. Stupidly, I agreed, fully knowing that I still had strong feelings for him and never wanted him to break up with me in the first place. A couple days later (yesterday), we planned to meet up. The time came and went, and eventually I figured out that he went on first date with someone and was starting a relationship. That really hurt, and now I'm a mess. The whole year, I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety, and now I get to know that I was so close to to getting him back but he's with someone else now.

The whole ordeal made me realize again that love is shit, and without love, life is shit. I can't move on from my ex, and even if I could, there's nobody else for me to move to. Except the guy that I hooked up with, *who also happens to be friends with my ex.* I hit him up last night anyways, because I'm so depressed that I don't even care. 

Life in general is terrible too. Relationship woes aside, I have one good friend, and nobody else. My brain is addled with mental disorders (autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder). My grades in school are terrible because I've missed weeks of it. I can hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, and even when I do, they just leave me more hurt than I was before.

It's all just terrible, and I don't think I can handle it much longer. I want to live, and succeed, and be in a happy relationship with someone that loves me. But I don't think I can. I'm too broken. All that's keeping me here is my one friend, my own fear of taking myself out, and an infinitely tiny and naive glimmer of hope that I might find my way out of this and back into someone's loving arms.",3,"break up with me, without love, life is shit ,Life in general is terrible, autism, ocd, anxiety, depression, possibly borderline personality disorder, hardly form meaningful connections with anyone, don't think I can handle it much longer"

I feel very alone around the holidays and try to make an effort to be with people because if I don't then I start a pattern of self-deprecation and self-hate and thoughts of suicide start to creep in.

My parents and brother are going to a friend's house (two of my former teachers) to ""have a good time of fellowship"" and blast fireworks at midnight. Totally sober. They want me there.

"I used to be very close with my cousin and felt very protective of him. However, when we were teenagers we grew apart. My cousin is autistic but he always wanted to live independently. Anyway, he left his parents house and started working around the country (United States).

Unfortunately, he ended up living with a woman who had some sort of personality disorder. She was attracted to the fact that he was autistic and liked this vulnerability. When he eventually said that he wished to leave and move on, she tied him up and kept him as a prisoner basically. She would leave him long periods of the day (tied up so he couldn't escape) while she was out at work or shopping and then she used to come back and sexually assault him basically (he is essentially asexual so he didn't even know what was happening to him).

This would have continued for god knows how long until a neighbour found out what was happening and alerted the police.

She is now in prison and out of his life. However, he has been essentially sectioned for a while (because of the mental state he was in) and he is very upset by this as he has always resented his autism 'holding me back' and he wants to leave and start travelling across the United States again. This has lead to him becoming suicidal (which of course is not going to make the doctors want to release him).

I hate seeing him as a shadow of his former self but everytime I visit he asks me if I can help release him?

The problem is that he wants a lifestyle of travel and doing labour here and there. he is very hardworking that is no problem. However, his autism makes him vulnerable and he refuses to see this?

"Hey guys,

I'm hoping someone could shed some light on a situation for me.
I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder and an anxiety disorder. I have been suffering from.bith severe depression and severe anxiety for about 9 months and after trying numerous things to resolve it (including self medicating) I had finally decided to give medication a try.

At first I was put on citalopram, this caused many severe side effects like increased anxiety, insomnia, constantly sweating, nausea, dry mouth etc. But I had a period where for 2 days I had worsening of depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and very impulsive - like - uncontrollable anxiety (with constant shaking for 2 days straight). I visited my doctor as this frightened me and immediately switched my medication to effexor. 

I recall before that episode had happened I had binged on counterfeit oxy and counterfeit Xanax (two pills I have been self medicating with as it's the only thing that helps me feel ""good""). I of course didn't bring this up to my doctor and I am now wondering is it possible that the drugs used to self medicate might be causing alternative effects with the antidepressants?

The effexor seems to be a better fit for me as I didn't have many side effects but I still had a similar episode I had before. It all starts with a painful headache, then horrible thoughts and followed by uncontrollable anxiety that doesn't seem to die down. I remember I self medicated the second time in hopes it would stop the episode but that either didn't work or made it worse.

"So, I want to share my thoughts about this year.

This year I failed nearly all of my classes, for the fifth time. I finally admitted that I am depressed. I also finally admitted that I have gender dysphoria. I started therapy, which is not going well so far. No improvements. I realized that no matter how much I analyze myself and my problems, I will never be able to solve them.

 I spent almost all of my days lying on my bed, doing absolutely nothing but staring to the ceiling. I gained weight. I am already overweight. I exercised less. I read almost nothing. I didn‚Äôt even play video games.

I have no friends, I made no friends, and I finally lost my only friend. She wasn‚Äôt reaiiy putting effort, I was making all the plans, and we met only twice, the whole year. I don‚Äôt think she liked me, she just hung out with me because she didn‚Äôt want to be rude.

As I said, I started therapy, and I realized that I have gender dysphoria. I have bigger problems. I have lots of bad personality traits. Lots of bad habits. Lots of stuff that HAS to be changed. I wasn‚Äôt able to make any change.

I . I spent days thinking about it. How it is going to affect me. My days are precious. And I did nothing with them. I was so scared that I will lose them, I wasted them myself.

I lost all my desires, dreams and interests. I had some hobbies that would make me feel fulfilled, no matter how I felt. I stopped doing them. I realized that things are not going to get better. I should stop trying.

I started to hurt myself. I singed my fingertips. I whipped myself with a belt. I hit myself. I scratched myself. Because I am a bad person. I am unable to change how I feel, how my life goes, or how I think. I am powerless. I have no ability to make a difference.

I am not suicidal. There is only one ‚Äúthing‚Äù that can push me to it. I am prepared to do it painlessly. Unless this ‚Äúthing‚Äù happens, I am not going to do it. I just hope that I will be able to do it, when the time comes.

So, it got worse this year. Its going to get even worse, I can bet on it. I failed my family. I failed at my life. I failed myself. I totally screwed up.

The best way that I could describe it is 2 tracks are constantly playing in my head. One that is normal and happy. I have lots of friends. I have a good job lined up and am doing very well at university. This track sends out lots of positive emotions and appreciates life.

But for the last 2 years theres another track that CONSTANTLY talks about how every single thing is meaningless. A gorgeous sunset? Life is meaningless, there is no purpose to anything. Having a good time with friends? Life is meaningless. The best way that I ccould describe it is like a stone lodged in your shoe that you have no way to remove, and you have to go on a 50 mile hike.

Well I've had enough. There have been times when I have a respite and I feel normal. But they last a couple hours, a couple days at max.

I don't htink I have depression since I think a lot of positive things often, am not socially isolated or anything like that. In fact when I read the stories of people who are depressed or anxious I ENVY them. Because they seem to be upset about something concrete. Like they feel inadequate. They are scared what others will think of them. They are scared of things IN THE REAL WORLD. But whatever is bogging down is so frightening because there is no concrete root. I couldn't care less what people think of me. There's nothing in the real world that totally takes over my mind, because no matter WHAT i am thinking about, always what is playing in the back of my head is ""this is pointless, this is pointless, this is pointless...""

* 2017, I hope you get not-quite terminal cancer in all of your toilet-parts and then get hooked on painkillers and end up selling your arse for heroin money as your family and friends look on and laugh.
* 2017, I hope all of your loved ones die in a car crash.
* 2017, you're not worthy of kindness.
* 2017, you deserve nothing.
* 2017, I hope you get pregnant and both you and your baby die in labour.
* 2017, I hope your dog stops loving you.
* 2017, I wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire. In fact the only time I'd even consider giving you any fluids is if you were in a burns unit, burnt from head to toe. I'd have a wank on you. And that's only if I had AIDS.

Lastly, fuck you, 2017. In a few hours you'll be dead. And I'll still be here. Even though I don't really want to be. I still beat you. And that counts for at least ...something. Probably. Maybe.

"I am terrified.

I am terrified because something inside of me is broken. Even as I write this, I am overwhelmed, because it Is impossible to describe it. I do not know how to describe it. The closest thing to it is hell. It is a state when all of your worst fears come to life. When your paranoia is palpable in the air. 

It is the place, when you were a child, that you could never even conceive of. Perhaps when you had a momentary glimpse of it in your bad dreams at night, but then you woke up.  Now that you are older, you live in it.  Your life is literally a nightmare.

My mind has taken everything away from me. The bipolar disorder which came unto me in early adulthood destroyed my life. It took away all of my relationships and capacity to have relationships. It took away all of my hopes and dreams. It ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects.  The idea of being homeless, discarded, abandoned and left to rot is a very real thing that is facing me. There is no bottom. Even when you reach it, you just keep pushing yourself further down, wallowing in your own guilt. The only real support I have left are my parents, and I don‚Äôt know for how much longer. I have caused them so much stress already. I have caused them to worry so much- how can one live with so many weights to bear on top of their original insanity?

I am in a place where everything Is dark. With feelings of inner death and hopelessness that make you want to crawl into a corner and cry.  The worst of it is the confusion. Knowing that you have tried everything, that nothing worked, and so you have no idea what you are even supposed to do anymore in life. Everything contradicts itself. Everything is a double-bind. Everything feels like a dead end, and every step forward feels like a step back.  So, you‚Äôre stuck. Worse still, you have no one to blame but yourself, so that‚Äôs what you do, and that‚Äôs of no use either.

So you‚Äôve become an expert in patience and endurance. You endure the shitstorm that is your reality. You grin and bear it, hoping it make it through another day.  You wonder how is it possible for a sentient being to be able to experience something so terrifying and painful. You also wonder what you did to deserve this- and if karma is real, then yeah, you deserve it.  There you are at it again- breaking yourself in, harder and harder.  Non-stop negativity, hostile and intrusive thoughts.  You don‚Äôt want to be around others because it makes no sense. How could they be normal, have a sincere smile, and you are like this? It doesn‚Äôt compute- it just hurts you more and makes you feel even more lonely.  So you live alone and isolated, and you wait it out. Minutes turn into hours, turn into days, turn into weeks, turn into months, turn into years.  Year after year goes by, and you experience some periods of normalcy or perhaps even joy, some success, but then as surely as the seasons alternate, your depression comes back stronger than ever as if on cue, and takes away any progress you have made.  It destroys any newfound hope you were able to cultivate and nurture.  It makes you once again cut off all ties, run away, and there you are again, once again cowering in your own little corner, your personal hell.

You hear all the naive New-Agers say ‚Äújust go for it!‚Äù, ‚Äúcarpe diem‚Äù, ‚Äúyou only live once!‚Äù, ‚Äúyou always have the choice to be happy‚Äù ""you can always turn your life around""‚Ä¶ and you know, it just breaks my mind even more.  They don‚Äôt understand, and you cannot make them understand, that this is not how it works, not for you. No, I am not some victimized snowflake, but there is something broken in my brain, in my soul. Some of the buttons, some of the options you have, for me, they are disabled. I do not have these same options, and no, it is not just because I believe that. I could live in delusion and convince myself otherwise, but it would change nothing.  I‚Äôm just fucking doomed like this, you see?   Yes of course, that makes me the toxic negative person, as if I enjoyed it. Rest assured, I don‚Äôt.  Oh and by the way, earlier on, I was able to turn my life around. I called on the help of some divine and holy miracle and relentless self-discipline and truly did turn my life around, but in the end, it never lasts. It always, without exception, gets taken away. Now, I am no longer able to call in the supernatural, the impossible. I can no longer will myself. 

It‚Äôs something that we experience that most people don‚Äôt. Perhaps they have had brief periods of hell, but not for as long as we do.  Every moment, I wish I were dead. I cannot kill myself for the typical reasons- it will hurt others and maybe, just maybe, there could be hope for something better one day, even though it may be inconceivable now.   

Personally, I‚Äôm really looking forward to the day of my death. Why? So that when I have my life review, I can finally know WHY?  Why all this pain, why all this suffering, for what?  I can look my guardian angel in the eye without any regrets and tell him: ‚Äúlook motherfucker, I did the best I could. I tried everything. There was absolutely nothing more I could do. Don‚Äôt you fucking dare tell me I could have been more ‚Äúopen‚Äù, or ‚Äúloving‚Äù. I tore my heart out to find my inner love, but there was none‚Äù.

So then by whatever process, I would be made to know, to understand why, and I hope to God that if reincarnation is real, that my next lifetime could be normal and joyous.   So far as I can see it, I do not feel that this kind of pain and suffering could be anything other than a) a punishment or b) a test of endurance. I can say with complete confidence that I have not learned or benefited in any way from my bipolar disorder. If anything, it has caused and continues to cause harm to myself and all those around me, and the worst of it is that there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.    Happy new year.",3,"bipolar disorder, cause harm, ruined my reputation and took away any career prospects, Terrified, inside of me is broken, life is literally a nightmare, mind has taken everything away from me, looking forward to the day of my death,"
"Maybe this will help someone or help me. I‚Äôm not quite sure. I‚Äôm a 24 m with three kids. I‚Äôm going to back up and let everyone understand.

  When I was about 1 year old my father obtained full custody of me. I rarely seen my mother. Once in elementary school she came around once a month. My dad was always hauling me around. Pretty much raised me just fine as a single father. He got married when I was 12 and she‚Äôs an alcoholic who is also a feminist. She was just that, a person married to my father. About 16 years old, towards the end I ended up getting a girl I‚Äôd been in a relationship with for a year pregnant. I attempted suicide as all I have done in my life is alcohol and drugs. Very foolish and ignorant and didn‚Äôt understand life. (I get it, selfish or whatever roast me later.) 
  We split because she had a very dark personality. She eventually got addicted to heroin. Which leads to my next venture at 18-20. I met a girl who was supposed to be a one night stand. I‚Äôd have barely held a job and was completely irresponsible. We had shared parenting of my oldest son. I was also in school and decided I wanted to be a firefighter. I took my EMT class and got a job working on an ambulance. She accidentally got pregnant with me because of a failed nuvaring.She was very controlling of me and which I hated the feeling of being controlled. As I had been a free spirit for pretty my entire life. I was staying at home by myself since I was about 6 years old.
  I ended up cheating on her when he was about 8 months old.Ew ah, bad guy. Immaturity at its complete and utter finest.  Understood. But wait there is more! I woke up late for work which I should‚Äôve been there at 4 a.m after I got home at around midnight from college classes. I lost my job and ended up failing my paramedic class by about .5% which meant I couldn‚Äôt go forward. So, I dropped out of college and lost my job. My parents let me move back in with them. I worked at papa johns just for a little money. Then came the first child support order. 
  Making barely 500$ every two weeks as a manager they decided to hit me as hard as they could with $200 a month. Not too bad but I couldn‚Äôt afford to live on my own. *queue sappy music* I decided to get back into working on the ambulance. I was disgusted of not making enough to live on my own. I took out about 20k student loans as well to buy the ex and nice 4.5k explorer. As well made sure we had everything we needed. As well as a car for me! Debt debt debt. I made less money working on the ambulance coming in at a whopping 8.57$ an hour. I worked about 80-120 hours a week. Straight 24‚Äôs day after day. I found different girls to be with because I still couldn‚Äôt afford to live because I only made around 1,200$ a month. We then found out my ex was addicted to heroin. We had shared parenting so the only way to remove the order without lawyer fees was to give my parents temporary custody.
  Alright, so at this point you‚Äôre probably like damn it can‚Äôt get that bad. As Billie mays says, ‚Äúbut wait there‚Äôs more!!‚Äù Oh boy I reflect on life a bunch. I accrued 3 credit cards which are completely maxed. Heheheh. So on the with story, I met a few different girls and they all had decent jobs which let me have my own place to stay. (Crowd yells:gold digger!!) It was at this time I decided the current girl was not cutting what I needed. Boom, break up with her, at the same time I found a new ambulance job which gave me a 1.50ish raise. He‚Äôll yeah. So at this point I don‚Äôt have any custody of my 2 kids and my parents were so gracious to take a child support order on me. (Since I‚Äôm making money, ya know 8.57$ an hour.) broke up with her and 3 weeks later she calls me to tell me she‚Äôs pregnant.(oh god dude you haven‚Äôt learned your lesson.) ((I‚Äôm 23 at this time.)) 

  I said I have nothing with my first two kids and barely see them. I work for nothing and I think the best option would be abortion or adoption. Around the same time I got that new job guess what? Child support claimed I made 15$ an hour and raised my child support to all intensive purposes to about 485$. My other order was recalculated at 8.57$ less than two weeks later as well saying the first order was at 200$. So the girl hits me with the, literally, fuck you pay me.

  That‚Äôs nice. I said screw it major life change. I need it, something. I found my girlfriend through a friend on Xbox live, what‚Äôre the freaking odds? I worked on an ambulance but they would‚Äôve taken half of every check which made the 15$ a day render pointless as I‚Äôd only be making enough to go back and forth to work. Well, of course I get a massive 315$ order. We‚Äôre up to 1100$ ish a month on barely above minimum wage. Now, did contracting work for my dad because I couldn‚Äôt make any money no matter what to pay bills. Hey, arrears!! You said fuck your kids so we‚Äôre going to fuck you!! Oh.. is that what happened.. I found a blessing of a job making 18$ an hour. Not doing my career because I cannot afford it. I‚Äôve been working overtime since 18. Practically killing myself to make ends meet. I am now forced to work on the road. I have to work overtime if I want to pay bills and eat food. Even then I still don‚Äôt make enough. I haven‚Äôt paid any debt off. I‚Äôm about 28 grand in debt. I‚Äôve had both my 2 kids taken from me. I didn‚Äôt have a car for 6 months so I had to borrow my dads truck which he took back. My co-worker sold me a car for 500$. Good guy. 

  Now we‚Äôre here. Today, almost the start of a new year. Everything, anything, I‚Äôve ever cared about has been taken from me. My kids. My career. My money. My life. My girlfriend gets mad at me because I can be insecure. What she doesn‚Äôt see is I‚Äôm holding on.. I‚Äôm afraid to lose anything else.. not afraid.. I‚Äôve lost motivation. I‚Äôve found god. I‚Äôve gained motivation. Spurts. I‚Äôm strong. I have to be. At 24 I act like I‚Äôm 45. Maybe 55 because I‚Äôm tired. I work 40 hours of overtime 7 am-11pm of hard labor when there is work. Most of the time there is not. So average of 40 hours. If I get a second job I‚Äôll get jumped by child support. Already happened. Seen a counselor to try getting prescribed adderall because my body is falling apart. My mind is blank. My thought process is almost gone. I can barely do the dishes correctly. My mother has taken herself away from me. My children have been taken away. He said I‚Äôm strong not depressed. I can‚Äôt even afford healthcare. I make too much as a ‚Äúsingle guy‚Äù to get Medicaid or the food card. I can‚Äôt get legal aid. I owe tax money too because I claim 2 for 1 person. They are trying to take my tax return that doesn‚Äôt exist either.

"**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY**

I am so confused guys. So, basically my story  began 5 months ago, It was triggered by reading the news about Chester's bennington suicide. I am 20 years old male, with a previous history of OCD(Fear of getting a heroin addict.), but I can't tell if it is the same or worse. It is horrific. Here is what happens. After I read the news, in my head went something like 'If he can do it, then why shouldn't I?' And I started having intrusive suicidal thoughts, I will give an example:

-A friend: Lets go and drink a coffe tomorrow.

-Me: Okay

-My mind: If I don't suicide by then.

So basically at the begining (the first few hours) It was terrifying, but I was unaware what is going to happen after this.

So I got pretty paniced and googled: 'intrusive suicidal thoughts' and major depessive disorder or OCD showed up. I entered both web pages and both said '10 times higher chance of commiting suicide.'

This was the moment when everything fell appart.

This was the moment when I felt this rapid change in my mind.

This was the moment in which I felt like a part of me changed into something horrific.(Okay this was too much movie like sentence, but anyway.)

So basically my life is pretty rough since then I will try to be as accurate as possible, I have days in which I feel relatively normal. So, here are the things happening in my head and body. Some of them are constant, some of them are not.

Intrusive suicidal thoughts which feel real. I really hope they are intrusive, and not true Suicide Ideation. With a confusion If I want them or not. Which is terrifying.

Knot in the stomach.

Whenever I look online for something to buy, there is a feeling like 'There is no point I won't be here soon' and a knot in the stomach.

Feeling like I can't do anything fun, like can't relax I don't know how to describe it.

Less interest in people.

Less apetite.

Sudden feeling of tiredness sometimes.

Nearly constant, uneasiness.

Scary feeling, when I imagine my life without these thoughts, it feels like kind of boring?! I don't know it this is the right word.

Feeling on the edge, feeling like my life is shortened, like I will do something bad soon.

Random feeling of life being pointless without a reason with a variating duration.

Random TERRIFYING Intese feeling like trapped in life.

Random feeling that I need to escape, but there is no place to.

When I am feeling bad, there are constant thoughts, random things I have read on google reddit, with a pictures of the article I was reading.

I stopped working, and now I feel like If I work or feel overwhelmed I will do it.

I stopped University becausw of it, and because I didn't find it interesting.(I made a mistake with chosing my subject.

Intrusive unsettling feeling real scenarious in which my best friend tell me If I want to work with him.(We had a pretty sucessful store.

Feeling like I don't want to admit that I am suicidal?!

Feeling like I don't want to get better?!? I tried finding a reason, but I can't think a reason why, like I stop thinking when I try.

Fear that I developed these thoughts, a few days before Chester's thing, and I try to see my chats to see if there are some signs, but it is impossible to be sure.(This is not a big deal, but I am trying to be as accurate as possible.)

At first I thought this is depression, however I don't show many signs of depression. Then I thought it is Anxiety, but It feels darker and realer than Anxiety.

Weird negative feeling when babies arround.

Random feeling like everything I see is too much?

Fear/Feeling like this is something unknown, incurable and it is impossible to feel like before.

**Now on new year everyone is wishing ""many years"" and it triggers anxiety everytime like i don't want it?!? Guys I am really sad over this what the fuck.**

Intense moments when I feel like I am losing control. (I will give you an example of what it looks and feels like.) It happened 2-3 times for the last 5 months.

And the most important and horrific:¬† Scary intense moment with like a physical urge ######6. As it follows: It is triggered randomly. This is what happens: life feels meaningless with a weird image stuck in the back of my head feeling, like future idk, feeling of unrasiness, unsettled feeling, negative scenarious, I try to calm myself with a positive thoughts, I succeed for like a second, then it feels like the negative thoughts, reinforce themselfs and become more and more intense, then I am like 'If i feel like i will do something i will go to the hospital, chill., then like 'it doesn't matter you feel trapped' and it becomes even more intense and more intense uneasiness feeling, i close my eyes laying in my bed, almost starting to feel normal for a couple of seconds, then i open my eyes and everything in my head is intense again, i try again to counter them, it becomes even more intense.

I have several questions:

What does it look like?

Does it look like actual suicide ideation/suicidality?

Do I sound suicidal? I am so confused

Thanks in advance.

"Today I turned 40.  I'm supposed to have this life things pretty figured out, right?  not at all.

I'm alone, a recluse, a hermit.  I go out a few times every week to get groceries, but only at night when I have an easier time walking with less traffic and people inside the store.  That's the extent of my real human interaction. ""Hi, thanks, have a good day"".

I'm too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to.  Two years ago I tackled my drinking problem, that's solved and lost a bunch of weight. I figured i'd try and improve myself, do what I could first before asking for help.
I went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff i'd been saving, like probably half of what I owned. My house has no furniture and everything is empty/barren, except for my one bedroom.

Now on antidepressants and seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm not sure how effective they are. I think they might help me focus a bit better on things i'd rather be focused on, but it's subtle.  I tried implying something more might be going on... or that I needed more help but my psychiatrist just seems fine with giving me SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics... just treating for depression/ocd... he doesn't seem interested in much beyond the norm and has never clearly come out and told me what my diagnosis was despite seeing him for like 6 months.

I've been unemployed for 2 years.
I have never driven a car.  I'll never have a family.
I'm not even sure i'll ever get another job. I don't feel like a person.

I struggle to do what's required for basic survival these days.
Lately i've been overeating and oversleeping.  I know it, I know how to prevent it by tracking calories and being mindful but like everything it's all so much work.

It's just difficult to see the point to any of this. My current plan of doing nothing is obviously not sustainable and not good for me... I just am unwilling to do anything about it.

If I get through another day without drinking, and manage to keep my house clean or did some other productive thing I try and say it's okay that I did good, but it's difficult cause I can say that however many times I want in my head and believe it but at the same time I still feel like I failed at life.  

I got no idea what to do.  Sell the house, move to the phillippines for a few years?  Just keep the status quo until they kick me out?  Get a job at Walmart or call center?  I dunno.  I got to do something different.  I wouldn't mind if someone just handed me a life in already good-working order and said ""here, trade up"".  I got no idea what a life that makes sense even looks like anymore.

I'm not sure what the point of this post is, I like just putting it down somewhere I guess and if people respond how they like that's okay too.

tldr; it's fine not to read it's just me babbling and mostly for myself anyhow.  maybe someone else can get something out of it.",3,"been unemployed for 2 years, drinking problem, never have a family, alone, a recluse, a hermit, too frightened to make many changes to my life, even though I desperately need to, went crazy for a bit and threw out old stuff"

"This is my little story. 

2017 was one of the hardest years of my life. I rang in the New Year drunk and drugged out at a music festival in hope that my feelings of depression and anxiety could be steered away. The whole year I fought an internal battle with my mind every day. I saw each day of my life pass by. I woke up many mornings hoping I could go back to sleep and not wake up for a long time. I had days of some clarity, but my illness just got worse. I tried everything to cure my mental illness such as becoming more religious, finding new hobbies, going out more but nothing worked. My mind would be temporarily occupied but I still came home each night to my bed of sorrow and hopelessness. My bad thoughts not only affected me, but one of the most important people in my life, my boyfriend. He tried to help me. He became my therapist which later in time broke him. I ran to him every time I needed reassurance and love. And he surpassed my expectations of an amazing human being. But instead of this causing me to get better, I only got worse. My mind switched this and I began to question why I wasn‚Äôt happy. How could I have everything in the world? (A roof over my head, healthy family and friends, attending an amazing college, and dating this awesome human being). I simply could not understand how I could be depressed. I began questioning my relationship. Began doubting my life, my identity, my ideas, my thoughts, and my feelings for everything. The doubting got so bad that I just became empty. I felt nothing. And this completely terrified me. I had seen myself morph from a happy, determined and cheerful woman, to a terrified, guilty, depressed and confused little girl. I had no idea why my life was falling apart. I saw myself deteriorate as the days, weeks and months passed. My life was falling apart and I had absolutely no control nor will to fight. I decided to end my relationship of 3 and a half years. One of the hardest decisions I had to make. Before my illness, I knew I was going to marry this person. Our relationship was no near perfect, but we loved each other so much. But now, how could I be selfish and be with someone when I didn‚Äôt have my life, my feelings, or my issues figured out. For once, I understood the stupid cliche of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs me‚Äù. My biggest fear of hurting him, had became a reality. My entire life completely fell apart from having a stupid thought that I labeled bad. I over thought this idea I had and it morphed into a fear, a phobia and a obsession in my mind. I simply wanted to be perfect for my significant other but I wasn‚Äôt. I have my first therapy session with my new therapist next week, January 5th. I have hope that this time, I‚Äôm able to stick with it. I regret not continuing with my therapist when I first saw myself changing. I think, if only I had stayed in therapy, if only I had continued my medication, my illness would have not gotten so bad. I was a ticking time bomb and I just ignored myself. 

If you‚Äôve gotten this far of reading my dumb post, please, I beg you, if you are going through some mental health issues, please get medical help. Please. It was one of dumbest mistakes I have ever made in my life. Please, listen to your body and your mind. I always took my mental health for granted and now I wish I could go back every day to a day of normality where I‚Äôm not struggling with my mind.

For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

Anyways, I've been dealing with depression for a long time. First got diagnosed with it my senior year of high school. That was also the year I got suspended for drug use (I attended a boarding school), and subsequently got waitlisted at 5 top 20 schools that I would have got into if it hadn't been for my suspension. I hate myself for it. Just finished my first semester at a random, no-name college and it was pathetic. While I work two jobs, I isolated myself, and as a result, practically have no friends left.

*-I am done with talks of suicide with my loved ones.*

I understand it is so stressful to have a partner or a daughter or friend who just shuts down every other night and says she wants to die. Even though I tell everyone I will not kill myself because I couldn't bear traumatizing anyone, I know telling them I want to die isn't helping me or them. It's time for me to put away suicide as my cry for help. If I really feel low I know the folks at /r/SuicideWatch are comforting and I frequent the sub to offer support as well. They get me. I will probably share with my will-be therapist as well instead of family and friends because they are not my therapists. Brings me to my next goal.

*-Stop treating family and friends as therapists.*

And by this I mean dumping my existential crises on everyone is not okay. They don't know how to help. I shouldn't expect them to help. I need real counseling from someone with experience and someone who can actually listen without getting burnt out from me. I know everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. But I am chronically depressed and anxious and I am always asking for far too much when I ask for shoulders to cry on. I am asking for shoulders to cry on for hours long. It's not good for anyone.

*-I will take care of my body.*

I notice differences in my mood when I eat unhealthy and my binge eating only worsens this. Regardless if depression makes me binge eat or if binge eating makes me depressed, I need to clean my diet up. I did a really good job of this last summer and I believe I can do it again. I can do this.

*-I will believe in myself.*

No more negative talk downs. I have to believe I can be better than who I was. I have to believe I can be better. I want to see myself as better. Maybe depression will never go away. But I have to learn to cope sustainably. I have to stop giving up at every mountain and wall and obstacle.

*-I will expect care from myself and only myself.*

No more dependence on others. I need to become more independent because I am very attached and attach easily.

Maybe a lot of this sounds like keeping things inside and bottling up. But I want to be as transparent as I can when it is appropriate instead of when it is inappropriate. I want to talk to a therapist exclusively about deep personal woes. I can tell a friend about a bad day sure. But my deep issues are really too spoken of too often these days and I know it needs to stop.

"Last year at this time, I was working in tech support being yelled at by people I don't know.  This year, I have a terminally ill family member and I'm struggling to find a place to live as I'm being kicked out of my old place.  This is compounded by the fact that the city I work in has no available apartments at the start of Jan/Feb.  The next closest city is about 100km away (an 1 hour+ drive).  

I've no idea what to do anymore.  Every day I wake up feeling sicker and sicker, my head is just full of clouds, I can't find my knife that I usually use to relieve the pressure (I suspect one of my friends stole it once they realized what it was for).  I'd ask for a hug, but I'm terrified of contact with people and it would just make me feel worse.  

It feels like there's a noise in my head that's just getting louder and louder, like someone turning up the volume on a TV station that's nothing but static.

It's been tough since November. TLDR: A friend of mine rapidly fell ill and has cancer - three tumors in his kidney which is the primary cancer and two tumors in his brain. Anyone who's familiar with stage 4 brain cancer knows how this ends. Best friend of 15 years cut off from me after I admitted to them I was diagnosed last week with Aspergers. Same friend has had my back through my mental health issues (bipolar, several anxiety disorders, anorexia, alcoholism) and somehow bails for autism?

I thought I couldn't feel lower until I was the one hearing about a NYE party I wasn't invited to by my other friend. Three friends and two are treating me like shit (or I'm over analysing, I don't know) and one's dying. I've been too sick with walking pneumonia to be able to see them in hospital.

I don't know what to do. I've been emotionally blunted/numb since August (physical inability to cry) as well as skills from years of CBT, DBT and CPT aren't really doing much. I feel like shit. I was the only one online on PSN tonight, the only one playing WoW and I can't focus on Netflix. I feel like a fucking loser and wonder why I'm always alone. It's not JUST because I'm sober, people still can hang out without drinking, but every year I'm alone. I was alone on Christmas. I was alone on Thanksgiving. I can't go out to Tim Hortons (my usual place to be to write and journal) because it's -37C and that's just not happening.

I have had my ups and downs, but mostly downs.  I was an alcohol and drug abuser but finally quit all of that to try and get better.  This was the first real relationship Ive ever had.  Even in HS and in college I never had someone just to call mine.

While this helped feelings subside a little bit...i always wished I had the balls to dig that razor in as deep as I could and just gashed up my arm.  But I am too much of a coward.

"Hi there this is my first post. I'm on a throwaway just because people who know me know my reddit. I'd also like to say my family knows about this and I'm currently in CBT which has helped in some ways, but not in others. I'm also on an antidepressant.


I'm 28. My *entire* life I was always happy, laid back, protective, loved animals and especially dogs with all my soul, loved my spouse of 8 years and naturally looked past their flaws, never felt violent or unstable in the slightest. I was connected to everything I cared about. I spent a few years frustrated and depressed but I still felt love, kindness and interest.



6 months ago I had a total and complete mental breakdown. I experienced a violent thought followed by 10 minutes of visceral fear, confusion and fury. I was scared I'd hurt my dog. I didn't want my spouse to come home incase I hurt them. for 2 months I had the belief I was secretly some kind of murderer and was afraid to be around either of them alone. Since then I've retained a resentment and almost hatred toward my spouse and I feel insanely uncomfortable around dogs, and my dog specifically. I harbor this belief that I am evil and I spend all day either furious, repulsed or annoyed by my spouse. I also feel completely disconnected from everything I loved: music, hiking, landscapes, art, books, sci-fi and fantasy.. it all feels distant and alien and something I shouldn't be engaging in. I spent 4 months crying every day and now cry maybe twice a week, just because I'm so keenly aware this isn't who I am and I hate it. 



I was known for being almost too laid back before this. No problems with anxiety or anger. I am so confused and hurt and all day my chest is tight and my mind is racing trying to find answers. I almost have a fantasy of leaving my spouse and today I had a horrible thought of 'if they died I might be way better off'. I tried to brush it off as a silly escapism thought (as in CBT) but the very existence of it made me want to kill myself. I actually felt like I wanted it. 7 months ago I couldn't imagine a life without my family, now I feel like a prisoner to them, and they're so damn supportive, because my spouse knows this isn't me. I'm just scared it is now.


I've been told it's OCD, but I think a lot of it may be depression as well. I don't know what to do really. I mean I know I should wait and get better before making any decisions about anything, but I feel so angry and stressed and I'm starting to snap and be really snarky to my spouse. It's driving me insane.



Can anyone help with some advice, or similar situations, or anything? This is kind of just a cry for help of any kind whatsoever. I'm getting better at dealing with it but it still feels like a railroad spike in my chest and a demon in my head. I feel so bad and evil, and it feels like any good thing I do is forced because I feel like doing the opposite.

I just had my second son. having to wait until the 17th to get back on my meds. I've been clean from severe self harm for the whole pregnancy. in trying hard to maintain. were all aware I will probably have post partum depression since I suffered so badly last time. its started already. 

we all know how scary it is to see yourself circling the drain. knowing you can't stop the fall. 

I have 3 people besides my toddler and newborn sons. my husband of 7 years, my mom, and my best friend. my best friend I don't really like to reach out to. even though she is amazing, I adore her and she's extremely understanding and supportive (because she struggles the same as me). I have an issue reaching out to her. I don't like telling her everything going on. I don't want to trigger her. and, I swear, no matter how much I adore her I just can't bring myself to reach out. 

my absolute best friend ever is my mom. she is a huge reason I have struggles but I have forgiven her over the years and were extremely close. the thing is, she is flaky. as. fuck. she is there for me so often I feel terrible for being upset but she often won't answer texts... like times where im really struggling. and just recently she told me ""I can't fix everything""... it hit me that im asking too much of her. the thing is... she told me she would be there for me since she is well aware of my mental issues. we all discussed my possibility of ppd plus my mental disorders acting up. but then she says that... so I feel like I can't ask for help again...my husband just went back to work and I've been doing ok but yesterday was hard. against the wishes of my depression I reached out to her... she had a new outfit for church.. she said shed come spend some time with me after church before husband got home... she didn't answer my messages. when she did she said shed be at my house ""soon"". it took an hour and a half to get to me with a 10 minute drive. by then mybhusband was getting off work within ten minutes anyways. she just picked up my son, her grandson, and left pretty quickly.. I even told her I didn't want to be alone... 

im a burden. always have been. 

I have a great drug regimen for my mental disorders. Is been hospitalized and my meds got worked out perfectly. well since my first son withdrew from my meds in NICU when he was born I wasmt allowed to stay on them for this last pregnancy. Understandable... I have a lot of guilt for making my oldest sick... 

well my pregnancy psych seemed wary of giving me my meds when I asked, excitedly, if I could have them back after baby was born... she kind of gave a ""well see"" answer... even though im fully diagnosed and im obviously mentally ill and I've told them how well my medications work. my arms are covered in pretty bad scarring. they know I need my medications. im also not on anything scheduled. I refuse things like benzos and adderal because of addiction issues. 

well after talking to my doctor last take and her seeming iffy on giving me my medications I've just been feeling more depressed that I may have to wait months tobget them. I got emotional today because im scared and depressed and he got frustrated with me. 

hes my only other support person. im out of options. he tells me I can talk to him but he just gets angry or frustrated with me. hes a good person. hes a great husband. he just gets upset that he can't do anything... 

but he had just told me yesterday I could talk to him about when im feeling down. then I get snapped at... I feel like I have no one again. 

I want to cut. I won't.. but I want to. I want to hurt myself in some way. I won't. I just want to. I just don't want to hurt mentally anymore. I want to talk to my people... but theyre tired of me. I want so bad to reach out instead of withdraw.. but I guess my only option is to just keep it inside. im tired of feeling like an attention seeker when I keep telling people I feel alone or depressed. or that I keep saying im scared of going downhill. I feel like im begging people to help me and everyone is just tired...

" Hello everyone, 

For the past year and a half, I've struggled with an intense internal conflict. According to my psychologist, I may suffer from a mild to moderate depression. To this day I am prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness and my intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up. Earlier this year it was worse, with thoughts of suicide constantly plaguing my mind (probably due to my obsessive thoughts). 

This time last year (Around the beginning of the New Year) I promised myself that I would seek help for what it was that was bothering me. This time last year, I felt hope that I would overcome this. Today though, I don't feel that way. Today, I feel like I am doomed to be alone for the rest of my life, that I am not going to amount to anything, that I will not connect with other human beings as intimiately and deeply as I want to. And that is when I am seeking help. 

The most prominent feeling I have felt throughout this year and a half old depression (it's possibly older than that) is loneliness. Sometimes it feels like an invisible brick wall cuts me off from everyone else, preventing me from forming true bonds with anyone. I feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health; my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me. My brother (who is overseas) told me that he would check up on me and asked my sister to do so regularly as well. That was five months ago, and my brother has only checked on me a couple of times and my sister has not asked me how I am doing once. Also, my mum had to get a referall to continue my sessions with the psychologist. We got the referral about a month ago and she has yet to give it to the psychologist because she says 'she keeps forgetting' and that I should be the one to remind her. That hit me hard, because it made me feel like my mental health was not her top priority. My parents also say that I can come to them with any issue, but I know that isn't true, because when I do my dad always puts on a judgemental tone which makes me feel like dirt. Also, when my brother came to my parents for help, he ended up getting kicked out of the house. 

As for my 'friends', I question the validity of our friendships. Just today I tried to talk to one friend about how I felt today, and it flew right over his head, and he talked about what he was doing instead. That especially hurt me, because it made me feel that maybe no one in this world wants to hear my problems. With my other friends, I want to tell them so badly about what has happened to me (not one of them knows I have depression and OCD) but I find it so hard to bring up in casual conversation, and I think some of them might be to immature to take it seriosly. I also constantly think about what the basis of my friendships consist of, whether they are deep or superficial. I feel most of them are the latter, which makes me question if I truly even have any friends. 

I guess what brings me here are these questions: how do I cope with all this loneliness and anguish when I feel so alienated and estranged from everyone around me? How do I connect with anyone who I feel isn't willing to truly get to know me? Am I doomed to this depression and loneliness for the rest of my life? Will I never connect with anyone in an intimate way where I can express my inner emotions without fear of judgement, because I feel I cannot even do that with my family.",3,"intrusive thoughts from my OCD that would never shut up,feel like my family and friends do not care about my mental health, my family is aware of it but barely checks up on me,prone to loneliness, sleeping problems, feelings of worthlessness, laziness, "

"With severe anxiety and body dysmorphia it's extremely hard for me to connect socially, though being more social is something I wanted to do this year.

Then today she wrote me that she won't attend the dancing courses with me out of consideration for her boyfriend.

"Early September to early December, for lack of a better description, was a never ending hell for me. Failed all my classes, withdrew from a lot of friends, neglected all my responsibilities, and abused drugs heavily.

In December, I had a stint of self harm, suicidal thoughts, and crazy self destructive behavior that really made me start to think about the bigger picture. I always dismissed my depression, because I thought I was a ""pussy"" for not even being able to feed myself or accomplish anything more than smoking pot, popping benzos and playing call of duty during the day.

But deep down, I knew I wasn't a ""pussy""/loser/failure. And neither are you. I know it's unbelievably hard/impossible to disconnect from that negativity when you're deep in the hole, so I won't tell you to push through it. Because that isn't how depression works, you can't just will yourself to get over it.

What you can do, however, is be honest with yourself. You have depression. It is not something you can shrug off or will away, and it's become a centerpiece of your thought process everyday. 

BUT, you can remember a certain point in your life where you felt happy/content in a natural way. Was it drinking a cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise? Walking around in the woods with headphones on? A good lift in the gym? Being in the company of a good friend? This won't come easy. I've found it helps to write these things down, because your depressed brain will make happy recall very, very hard. Definitely try it out a few times if it doesn't work at first, over the span of multiple days/weeks. This is a process, not a quick fix. 

Now compare those memories to your current day-to-day routine. Me personally, I realized that my college depression was eating me alive, because I didn't have a routine. In high school, I was forced to do the same thing every day. As much as I hated it, I was achieving SOMETHING 5 days of the week. Going to classes, having to get dressed, made a huge difference in my life. Once I moved out and had freedom to do anything, I ironically did NOTHING every day. And that's when I realized really what the root of my issue was. Without accomplishing something productive on a day to day basis, my reward centers slowly started to fade away.

So I forced myself to wake up at 7AM every day, and walk around in the morning for 5 minutes. It was so fucking hard. I completely failed to do it for about a month, then got lucky one day and woke up feeling okay. Managed to accomplish those two tasks. Whoa! That wasn't so bad. I also had to cut out drug use from my life, because pot, benzos, and amphetamines were making it impossible to wake up in the morning.

Granted, I am nowhere close to being out of the woods. If I were to slip into drug use and disregarding my routine every day, I would fall back exactly to where I started. BUT, once you start to feel better, and REALLY internalize the negative effects depression has on your well-being, you can start to be much more proactive about your recovery. I honestly believe the biggest mistake all of us make when we start to feel better, is to disconnect ourselves with how we felt while depressed. It's not something you can leave behind and go back to your old ways. 

Not exactly sure how helpful all of that was, but I hope someone finds it beneficial. 

And for those reading who are currently deep in the hole, just start to introspect. A lot. Write things down. Post on here. Be creative. Hell, even talk out loud if it helps. When depression really, really kicks you to the ground, it has to be the #1 focus in your life. 

And, of course, feel free to reach out to me if you all ever need anything. Everyone deserves to feel content, fulfilled, and happy. Yes, you. I know it doesn't seem like it, but life is worth living &lt;3

Happy new year everyone :) ",3,"abused drugs,withdrew ,loser, failure,"

"Hey guys, long story short I've had a long history of depression/anxiety and I was prescribed Effexor towards the first half of the year (around April I think). Initially it lifted my mood, but very quickly it began to take a toll on me. I found that I felt completely disconnected from my actions, like I was a stranger inside my own body, and more worryingly I lost the ability to really feel any emotion. I've had to imitate behaviours and emotions even though I am not feeling them in order to still seem like I'm functioning. The only real feelings I've had as of late have been bouts of anger and a habit of splurging on stuff I don't need and overeating which I never really did before.

My doctors have been extremely unhelpful and I made the decision two months ago to slowly taper off my dosage. I was on 75mg a day, and I began by opening the cases of the pills (there are six small capsules within a plastic shell) and removing one of the capsules, over time ramping it up to only 3 capsules a day, the equivalent of 37.5mg. One day I decided enough was enough. I cannot be held prisoner with this fucking drug anymore, it's too much for me and I long to feel SOMETHING again beyond anger. I quit cold turkey 8 days ago and it's been rough, really rough.

I'm getting a TINY BIT of feeling again. Over Christmas I didn't really feel much at all, but I felt a bit happy the day after Christmas spending time with my family. My sex drive is beginning to return and my dick suddenly works again. 

As for the withdrawal effects, it's been rough as fuck.  I get ""brain zaps"" which is very common for people coming off Efexxor. It's like a sudden jolt in my consciousness and happens anywhere between 20-100 times in an hour. I can handle that though. I'm lethargic and it's hard to move my hands properly. I'm experiencing a lot of hot flushes and high temperature. I'm sweating balls when I sleep and during the day.

Worst of all is I'm getting bouts of extreme anger. Over time I've become a much more chilled person, but this anger I'm feeling does not feel like me at all. I'm convinced it's withdrawal effects. I get so mad I want to scream at full volume and smash everything around me. I've never consistently felt like this even in the past when I struggled with anger. The slightest thing infuriates me and I'm overreacting to everything.

My family have no idea how long I've been struggling. I made the decision a while ago not to bring it up because it only makes things worse. They made it very clear they want to help and share my issues but when I've spoken to them about how I feel in the past it has scared them and they have been over-protective. I choose not to rely on anybody else and I don't have anyone to share how I feel with so I felt like I wanted to make a post here.

I have become distant with all my friends and family. I felt such a disconnect with life in general at the start of the year that nothing really feels real anymore. I don't care about anything, I don't want to make an effort with anybody and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel. I don't feel like anyone would understand. I feel like I'm not meant to be here and that I'm defective and people can just sense it when they're with me. Everything seems to superficial and pointless and nothing gives me joy anymore. I have vivid fantasies of pushing everyone I know away and living alone in solitude and never having to contact them again, starting life over. Even though I'm close to my family and have some very good friends, it never feels like enough and I've lost a lot of close friends recently by cutting them out of my life because they were toxic people.

I feel hazy, I'm sleeping bad and it's hard to focus, but I'm 8 days in and no matter how bad it gets I'm staying off these torturous drugs. Think long and hard if Effexor is really for you. It has become a prison for me and online research has shown me that it's the same for others. I am determined to beat the dependence, but I worry about how long I'm going to feel like this. I can handle a few months, but what if it never goes away? I feel incredibly alone in all of this. 

This is a bit of a trainwreck of a post but it feels a little better to put how I feel into some semi-cohesive manner. Has anyone else gone cold turkey and made it? How long did it take?",3,"prisoner with this fucking drug anymore,  bouts of extreme anger, family have no idea"
"Hey all,

I've been on Lexapro (generic) for a couple years now, no issues.  Currently 20mg dropping to 15mg tomorrow.

This week I started Wellbutrin XL (generic) at 150mg.  I feel good, little wired, but not bad.

I'm concerned with the possibility of seizures. I've brought this up to my doctor, waiting on a response, but I figured I'd get more opinions.

"Throwaway because my other account is related to my occupation. TLDR: sick of the grind of depression, no support system, just need to get it out.

Basically, I have no will to live. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind ceasing to exist. I‚Äôve been like this one other time in my life-when I was 15 and hospitalized for 4 weeks. During that time, however, I did want to die. I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin from anxiety but at the same time,  I have zero energy or motivation to get out of bed. Recently I‚Äôve had some serious financial problems, but nothing else has changed. I have an amazing job that people dream of and thousands of people would take in a second.I live in a beautiful area of the country, and I have food to eat and a roof over my head. I have a couple friends and a boyfriend and two cats. I‚Äôm so depressed at this point that the none of this seems to matter. I just want to sleep as much as possible. 

I‚Äôve been on and off antidepressants since I was 9 years old (28 now) and it‚Äôs been 3 solid years with none. I felt good for a long time and one of the worst parts of this is knowing that at any time, for the rest of my life this can and will return. For no reason. And I worked so hard to wean off medications and it‚Äôs very discouraging to know it‚Äôs time again. 

I have a doctors apt at the end of January to ask to be put back on meds. Definitely not looking forward to the usual 6 week haze that follows. I‚Äôm also in the medical field, and sadly there is a pretty big stigma associated with mental health. It‚Äôs not respected and no one talks about it. Patients with it are taken less seriously.  I feel very alone. I‚Äôm  estranged from my family for many years and moved across the country 3 years ago and have a very small circle (like 3 people.)

I guess I just needed to get it out. And continue to analyze how I‚Äôm going to make it and function for the next 4 weeks (and then 6 weeks for full effect of meds) and I‚Äôm just sick and literally tired of the beast called depression. I know it can get better, I‚Äôm just tired of waiting.

I'm sick of people commenting on my looks. Whenever i try to feel better about myself, someone rips me down. I hate the way i look. I want to get a breast reduction but I don't have money.

I have not smoked any since i started my meds, but im thinking about maybe having a joint when i get home (im abroad for the holidays). Would that be a bad idea?

"I'm jacob. I'm 16 years old and I live in Minnesota. I'm posting this because I believe I had an intense moment of clarity while I was stoned. (Not the good kinda stoned) I mean where it was just too much. 

    So my buddies came over to my house yesterday. I'm usually not depressed but just a little lost sometimes. Just every once in awhile I'll get depression that will last from a day to a week usually. And one of them brought some really potent weed. And we were gonna do it both days of new year ( New Year's Day New Year's Eve.) 

    So last night was New Year's Eve. And we were smoking it. One of them didn't,  it was just two of us and we were out in my old broken pickup truck freezing and smoking weed with a lighter with almost no fluid but it worked. A bottle and a 3/4in socket pressed into a water ballon filler as the bowl. It looked stupid but it worked. And we honestly had a fun time laughing about how stupid it seemed how other were inside and we're sitting in an old pickup truck smoking weed out a bottle. That night was fun, just sitting around chilling.

    So the next day was not as fun. We were smoking some now in the morning. We smoked like 2 full bowls with low tolerance. And we were so stoned we were freaking out. It was not fun and felt very depressing and lost. The buddy that brought it had a little more than me and he got sick from it. I didn't but it certainly felt like it. While I was sitting in the other living room coming down. It suddenly struck me that I'm a nobody. That all these things that I do are not what I want to do.

    It's about school is what my realization was about. It's a pretty small school so that's nice. But that's not what it's about. It's because I always talk about how I want to drop out and all about what shitty jobs I'll have to work. And I think if I drop out then I can just sit at home and play video games and live in those games in my head. But I realized sitting there that I was wrong this whole time. It's laziness that making me not do work and not give a fuck about school. I suddenly felt that I didn't want to drop out, how I wanted to do the school work. To not be shamed for what my opinion is about it. I feel that I have just already thrown my life away. I have all Fs in classes. And I feel I just need to do better because I haven't been trying one bit all school year so far. I feel I need to change it all then I think I would be happier. 

    I'm probably not making sense at this point my mind is still somewhat foggy cause I was like tripping for awhile from the weed. Btw I don't smoke that much just every once in awhile.

    But now I'm asking for your advice on what I should do and tips to do it. I feel like I can't but I know I have to try.

    I think if I finish school and graduate. I could do what I want then. Have a place to call home. Work a job and then when not working just have fun then like video games as an example I suppose. Just thinking about how I could have my own home and to love myself and not be ashamed that I'm throwing my life away.

"23F here. I have depression that comes in waves, and then recedes after maybe 6-9 months, with no warning and for no apparent reason. This has been going on since I was 18.

During these lows, I get suicidally depressed. I see the world through an incredibly negative filter until nothing seems to matter much at all. I often doubt that reality is even real sometimes, I feel so detached.

Since nothing matters and I kinda plan on maybe killing myself soon anyway, I tend to lose my inhibitions. I tend to feel so much pain that I can't expend energy pretending to be happy or living up to society's expectations. Nothing matters, and Devin's a prick, so I'm going to tell Devin he's a prick, consequences be damned! 

My depression is receding again and I am cringing at the things I did when life seemed to have no purpose. I am now having to pick up the pieces of what I destroyed in my depressive period- I'm a straight A student outside of these lows, but fail most classes during them. Next semester I plan to graduate with my Bachelor's, but I'm going to have to work hard to make up for lost time to even get above a 2.0.

Over the last few months I have cried in public, at work...I have snapped at people- depression tends to make me extremely mean. I always suspect people hate me and have bad intentions...my own grandmother, an angel on Earth, took me shopping, and I was totally pissy the entire time. This is partially because depression makes me feel physically horrible, exhausted and headache ridden constantly, but I still feel like an awful person.

While not depressed, I drink like a sane person. While depressed, I give up on moderation completely and drink as much as I want whenever I want. Tuesday at noon? Let's get blackout drunk! There is no God anyway!

Yeah, I showed up at Thanksgiving very visibly hammered, to dinner with my extended, religious family that doesn't drink. Before my depression started to melt, I just shrugged at how horrifyingly taboo this is. WHO CARES IF THEY'RE JUDGING ME? I'M BEYOND HOPE ANYWAY!!! HATE ME LIKE YOU ALREADY DO!!!

4th week: 10mg Celexa &amp; 150mg Effexor

5th week: Psychiatrist appointment

Now, i'm on week 3 taking 20mg Celexa &amp; 75mg Effexor and i'm starting to get very depressed. I am not having suicidal thoughts and if i did i would go straight to the ER. But i am having depression. So my question is, should i keep on pushing through ? Go back to 30mg Celexa &amp; 37.5mg Effexor ? Start 10mg Celexa (Maybe stay on 20mg) &amp; 150mg Effexor a couple days early to get a higher dose of Effexor in my system ? 


It's strange because my anxiety hasn't been bad since starting.

The reason i'm asking here is that my psychiatrist is on holidays and i dont see him until mid January.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks",3,Psychiatrist appointment
"I'll try keep it brief. My younger sister and I have a good relationship, but she's never really talked to me about depression and her apparent anxiety. I recently got to know she's weekly been visiting the nurse practitioner at her school, and she called our family the other day. My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now.

I've read through the talking tips under this sub, but I'm unsure how to deal with this. I have been good at lone-wolfing myself, and never really been depressed, but I'm a good listener. I don't want to start talking to her directly about the issues either, but I'm certain she haven't tried hiding going to the nurse either (she writes appointments on her calendar in her room)

"I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore.

Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. 

The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well.

"Hi all fellow friends who are suffering from depression!
I have IBS, suffer from sleep paralysis almost every single night, be a paranoiac. To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well. Things have been hard for me for a few years. I don't want to go out and meet strangers and spend most of my time in my room.

However, a new year has come and I am determined to regain control over my life. I don't want to give in to these diseases that easily. I am too young and I have to support my family as well. I have maintained a habit doing exercises everyday for 2 weeks (running and hitting the gym). Now I want to start reading to understand more about all the aspects of mental health. I would be much grateful if you guys can recommend any books you think would be of great help to a person fighting mental illness.

"Hi guys, I was just wondering whether any of you have been in this state of mind because. I can't find anything when I google it. 

I am a 21 year old male from the uk and have recently graduated and got a job out of uni. I'm from a comfortable family and my parents are still together and have been great all my life. I have a good group of friends who I see regularly, but all my life I've had a sort of apathy for living.

 I'm not sad and I'm even happy most of the time but I can't help feeling that life is fairly meaningless and it has always been really difficult for me to do anything. I don't really enjoy anything other than smoking weed and doing downers, such as Xanax, codeine and Valium. I'm addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs everyday too, but despite this I manage to hold my life together, even though I am high most of the time. For me, everything in life takes the same amount effort, from working to going out or seeing my friends, and so far I have managed to keep everything together by promising myself to do 2 constructive things a day although this has become really draining recently and I'd prefer to just lie in bed all day. 

Despite not really caring about anything I also get really irrational fits of anger and always ending up breaking stuff or ruining friendships and I don't know why. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend who knew about my weed use but not much else, although she knew I did other stuff. 

She was the thing I cared most about in life and she honestly made me care about life for a year, but for the last 6 months I've been slowly going back to not caring. I was just irrationally angry and I broke up with her for no reason and even while I was doing it I couldn't stop myself and I've fucked up the best thing in my life. I really struggle communicating my feelings with her and so I just blow up and blow things out of proportion. 

Without her I don't care about anything and I just can't be bothered to go on living everyday feeling dead inside and occasionally very angry. But I can't be with herb because I screw it up every time. 

I don't want to die because my parents would be devastated and I care about them and my sister. But I do want to be dead because I can't be bothered to do life anymore, so I was wondering whether anyone else feels like this and if you have any tips as to how to keep going with it all?

Thanks for any responses. ",3,addicted to weed and really struggle not to do harder drugs

"Hello!

I am a 23 year old female that has struggled with anxiety her whole life. I have taken many things but nothing really ""fixed"" me. Xanax and similar drugs just slowed my thoughts but didn't give me the courage or confidence to engage. Antidepressants never helped enough to notice. 

The only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol. I felt I could speak clearly and engage with all types of people. I had confidence and just loved life. But obviously I can't drink every day nor do I like drinking really.

Depression has always been on and off for me. When I don't have a lot going on I get depressed. I was also pescribed an anti depressant for my migraines from the age of 15-18. I didn't know it was an antidepressant and when I forgot to take it on a trip, I had a complete emotional break down. Safe to say I STOPPED taking it. Now my depression comes and gos.

I also have a stupid past of abusing ""rave drugs.""  I have abused MDMA/molly a few times in the last 2 years. I really was uneducated at the time this could be very bad for someone with my issues and I feel like this past made my depression much worse/an actual problem. Trust me, not doing these things again. (I was very sheltered as a child so moving out was a huge learning experience)

I currently am living a healthy lifestyle. I eat pretty good and workout almost everyday but I just have been feeling HORRIBLE lately..

Extremely depressed. Nothing I used to do for fun is fun anymore. I feel this weight on my chest almost all day/everyday. I feel like all my social interactions are forced. I don't genuinely care what anyone is saying nor care to respond. And when I do to ""seem normal"" nothing comes out right or I just seem so fake.

My anxiety has been very bad. I have very negative thoughts, constantly think about my finance leaving me or people I love dying. Thinking I'm so disgusting. Literally no confidence at all. Going ""blank"" in social situations. Just not feeling human very dissociative. I run my own business and have panic attacks all the time (usually business related things cause this) or arguing.

This unmangiable feeling has been going on for a month now. Alcohol doesn't even seem to help anymore. And this sucks because I am actually very fun, intelligent and funny. I used to be the life of the party (with the help of alcohol or being comfortable with the people I was with) and now I literally can't even force myself to pretend I'm fun.

I hate living this way and really don't want to be on antidepressants.. I want to try something more natural because natural things have worked before. 

Can someone recommend something to me? I've been reading about nootropics the past 2 days and am very interested. 

Thank you!!",3," have a stupid past of abusing """"rave drugs, only thing that ever USED to help, and still does time to time was alcohol"
"This is my first time on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if my post doesn‚Äôt meet the rules. I‚Äôve just been wanting to get everything off my chest for so long and this is the first place it seems like I can do that. 

A month ago I started seeing a LCSW because an HR lady at work recommended I take advantage of the EAP program after I spent an hour and a half bawling my eyes out in her office. I was there because I knew I was going to have to go back to the hospital and I didn‚Äôt want to. I thought I could work from the hospital because I can‚Äôt leave work for that long. I‚Äôll just get that much further behind. 

That hospital at the tail end of December was my 4th stay for the year, 3rd for a crisis. I have Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in my voluntary muscles. I was diagnosed at 18. I grieved. I pulled my boots on and I kept going.

Except I don‚Äôt want to keep going anymore. I‚Äôm not suicidal, but the thought of having to take medicine in 3 hours and 20 minutes so I can stay ahead of the weakness makes me tired. I‚Äôm so tired. I live my life in 4 hour increments between pills. 

I‚Äôm 23 now. In the almost 5 years since I‚Äôve been diagnosed, I‚Äôve had 5 crisis events that I‚Äôve had to be hospitalized for. 3 of those included a feeding tube. 1 of those included the flu and ICU. 

Normally I can push through and get back to routine. This time I can‚Äôt. I want to cry. I am crying as I type this. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs different about this time. 

My counselor (social worker? Therapist? What‚Äôs the appropriate term?) says that I‚Äôm depressed. She said that the first day she met me. She says I‚Äôm scared. She thinks I should quit my job because of my ‚Äòdisability.‚Äô Or that they should at least be offering me accommodations. She says that I don‚Äôt tell my husband or my family how I really feel about my Myasthenia Gravis and that I don‚Äôt allow them to properly support me like I need them to. She says that I need to bring them in for a session so she can mediate and I can tell them how I really feel. 

I‚Äôm not comfortable with that. I don‚Äôt know how I really feel. I don‚Äôt want them to know how I really feel. I have spent 5 years protecting them from the burden that is my disease until I can‚Äôt protect them or myself. My husband and my parents are the most supporting people I have ever met. My mom stays with me when I‚Äôm in the hospital. My husband does anything I ask of him, even if it includes picking me up off the floor when I‚Äôm too weak to stand by myself. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to allow them to see me weak. They already see my muscles weak. I can‚Äôt be emotionally weak too. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do about my therapist. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to be accomplishing. I mostly just go in there and cry about stuff and then she tells me more about how she wants to talk to my husband and my parents. She also found out about me being a graphic designer and has asked that I do a branding campaign for her. How do you say no to someone you‚Äôve only spoken with 3 times about very private matters? Now I feel like there‚Äôs a line that‚Äôs been crossed and it‚Äôs not going to get resolved until I finish the work and stop the sessions. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing any of this right. 

My symptoms are getting worse. I didn‚Äôt know that Myathenia Gravis was progressive even with treatment. It used to just be my speech and swallowing. Now it‚Äôs in my arms and legs and it‚Äôs hard to breathe. I had surgery in July to hopefully help get me off some of this medication and stabilize my symptoms. I knew that the surgery could take 2 or 5 years to work. I didn‚Äôt realize how hard it would be to wait. I didn‚Äôt realize that I would crash. I was as close to pre-MG normal as I had ever been and I crashed. Hard. I didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge that the surgery may not work.

I just want to stop crying every time I think about it. I want to stop thinking about it. It‚Äôs like a broken record in my head. All day every day. Except all the record is playing is static because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm thinking about. Am I scared? Have I isolated myself from any help I may get? All I know is I don‚Äôt want to be strong anymore. I don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so courageous for dealing with this.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be. I just want to sleep.

"I have MS and I have done everything to pull myself together and build a life. It went ok for half a year but then it started. I was VERY motivated for university, I started my first year of physics major in October and made very healthy habits(eating healthy, sports, morning routines, reading every day, planning the day and week, working deeply without distractions, etc.) and it went pretty good. I didn't expect everything to go perfect, far from it, but I did expect to have some control. But then we had to talk about medicine. My parents are superstitious and I am a sceptic; I think critically and I analyse everything to truly understand the situation. My parents wanted to start alternative medicine and I am fine with that for as long as it is not dangerous as I wish to let my parents be at some ease. They found about this Vitamin D3 treatment which can be VERY VERY dangerous(my kidneys can fail any day) and we had soooo mannyy FIGHTS over it, it was chatastrophic. My mum started to hurt me bad with her shit and dad was just ignorant and arrogant. Moreover, the medicine for MS is VERY DANGEROUS as well, a girl of my age got diabetes and Thyroid Disease so she had to even drop out of fucking musical academy which was her dream just because of MEDICINE. We had countless talks and fights and shit ever since my uni has started and everything has gone to SHIT. All my habits are gone, all my plans are ruined and I probably even have depression now.

You see, when I got the MS diagnosis I spent A WEEK having an existential crisis and I really decided I wanted to be a physicists no matter what, as I felt like that is part of my identity, to truly become a master in something. I have decided to be a physicists roughly a year before that, however now that decision became a huge part of my life. But every time we fought at home I couldn't work for days no matter what; I tried to push and concentrate and I even started going to library to study but after a month even that wouldn't help anymore. I have very good friends, but they are of little to no help and I LOVE my parents, but they try way TOO DAMN HARDDDDDDDD, they are beating my mental health down every day. 

For example: yesterday I was feeling very depressed even though I felt motivated the day before, it just came out of the blue, so I was super slow and lazy and it was impossible to get out of bed. My parents saw that and started worrying, the first thing they said is that I need to snap out of it and that im just pretending because I am lazy, do you know how much that hurt????!!!! But I am rational and I was somehow able to keep my anger and sadness and pool of emotions down to explain them FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME what is going on with me and why is it so but they just wouldn't understand! This time they threatened me throwing me out and you know what, I fucking agreed because I was so desperate that I literally thought that there is no other way. I was SO TIRED that I thought this was my destinity, that im such a pure piece of fucking shit that even my parents want to get rid of me. I just wanted to go and just live my life. I even started planning on how to get a job and shit, it was PURE TORTURE. I have cooled down since then, but now I have not worked for school yet again and I am even more behind, yet fucking again, will it ever end? Why am I even trying with bloody physics which is HARD when I know I have such a terrible condition. I magically passed almost all the midterms and everyone was happy that I did and they kept saying I am amazing and shit, I was so angry because NO ONE understood how much I am suffering because I am not able to learn 10% of what I should be learning, its like being a kid in front of a toy store looking through glass at a toy you wanna sooo desperately have but you KNOW you will never have it. I even tried to talk to a psychologist and it helped the first day and I was so happy that I finally had some real help, but then she said she would call me next week for next talk from the meeting but she never called and it has been a month since then now and I dont even know her name nor can I contact her, she is a psychologist at the hospital! I feel so dead, I don't knwo what to do. Every singe day I fight myself, I fight to gather some energy and motivation to do the work and have fun, but every week is ruined by fighting with parents and now almost every day is ruined by just being empty, dead without energy and tired and with hate for myself and shit. 

I feel lonely, not understood, desperate, without any energy(cannot even have fun, im forcing myself to have fun more than actually having it), im scared all the time, i feel like people just wanna quickly be done with me cuz im a burden, i have insomnia, i sleep too long, sometimes i cant eat at all while on other times i binge eat like crazy and i find myself looking for food every 2 minutes, im scared of studying, im scared of talking to anyone but a professional cuz they wont understand, Im overthinking all the time, i cannot concentrate anymore at all(e.g. got a huge burst of motivation cuz of a fight few days ago and started to work on math but it lasted 15 minutes and then i felt HUGE resistance and my mind went batshit crazy). The only thing missing is the thought of kling myself, but i doubt it will ever cross my mind for more than 5 seconds, as I am rational enough AND I know very well that life is beautiful and valuable. I just CANNOT find a way out of my situation, im caught in this room with walls closing in on myself, but there has to be a way out, but im close to breaking, right now I spend 90% of the time being depressed and then I have these rational outbursts that are seemingly the product of my past self and they seem to protect me and that is why I am here and not dead yet. My healtjh is getting much worse though and MS is getring worse too, ive gotten a new attack a few months ago and it is still active, I cant feel my feet normal anymore, i feel much less and the feeling is weird and its driving me fucking crazy, tho i have gotten a bit used to it. Now I do t even know how I feel about my parents, i fucking love them, but at the same time i hate them for driving me crazy, but i dont blame them, but i still do, but I really really do not know how to feel about them. For new year they were all kind and shit but i cannot take this kindness seriously anymore. I know they mean it but i cannot smile normally i cannot be happy. But i still want to be on good terms with them. What a shitty family we are.

I posted this here to gather some feedback information, new ideas, or new information to help myself because I do not want to give up, ever, for I still believe I can become a physicist, even if it sounds fucking stupid. If there is ONE FUCKING THING that I want to do in my entire life is to research physics and solve math problems. As you can see, I still have MS to deal with, so even if I somehow deal with depression, I will still have this monster over my head which could strike me down any time. For example, how will i deal with a family, I cannot imagine putting such a massive burden on someone I would love, will I ever even have a wife and kids?(I hugely respect what Hawking did and I think it was the right thing to do)

"This is my first time posting here. I have been mentally going downhill for a few years now. About 3 years ago my dad got sick with cancer and went through all the treatments, radiation, surgeries, chemotherapy and eventually when all else failed, immunotherapy. He ended up in the ICU on a ventilator for a few weeks until he ultimately passed away. This whole experience broke me. He was my person. My mom and I aren't very close. I have no other close family members. I definitely felt myself slipping once he got sick and then watching him get worse and worse. He died in April and I've been functioning but I feel fucking terrible most days. I wake up feeling so shitty, like complete despair. I feel like this planet and most of the people on it suck to be frank. I never had a clear cut direction or passions to follow so I find myself thinking about my purpose a lot. I do wish I could end my life some days but I know I never will. 

I go to therapy. I have tried some medications but honestly I haven't found anything that works. I don't enjoy anything really so I don't have hobbies. I do have a fiance. He is a saint. He's my only real support. He's been getting me through.

"So I'm 23, I've survived two rare cancers that have badly affected my education in high school and university. I graduated university with a bachelor degree in business but my GPA is horrible, as my physical and mental health during my studies was terrible. My grades improved over time but the damage was done. I'm now looking for my first full-time job (I have a year of part-time work experience) and have had no luck since graduating in August of 2017. 

Its gotten so bad that I constantly doubt myself, I feel that I am stupid and really have no future prospects in terms of career. I constantly use various tools to try to justify to myself that I'm not a failure (such as IQ/Psychological Tests), but they really don't mean anything. I feel that I have to justify myself for things outside that were out of my control and obviously, people in the real world don't care and will more than often see me as a liability.
On top of this, due to my treatment of my second cancer, my left arm lacks fine motor skills. I'm already handicapped in the competitive job market and why would any employer hire me over some other graduate with better marks and is physically capable. 

My personal confidence is at an all-time low as well, being a 5'4ft balding 23-year-old doesn't help me fit in and frankly, with my understanding of how nature works, I am screwed. I am working on improving my overall physical fitness and am I by no means anti-social but I feel that I can't relate to any of my peers.

No one helped me during my life (outside of my family) and I have no idea what I want to do, I'm not passionate about helping others or any career objectivities or anything at all. I just want to work and be productive so that I can reach a point where I don't have to be. 

I think that I am an intelligent, moral person that can actually bring some value to whatever I do but no one is going to give me chance, because why would they? I don't want to end up on welfare and I want a successful career, I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a purpose. Sure, it's my fault, I could of done better and now just like most of my life, I have to learn the hard way.   

What do I do? Do I go back and study something else to gain a better GPA (and more student debt)? I don't really have many options. Even if I go study something in demand, like engineering or IT, who is going to hire someone in a hands-on profession who can't fully use both hands?

"Hello r/depression,

Recently I have finally made sure that my tolerance to all kinds of psychiatric medicines is higher than average. That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects. Personally I like the effects of the medicine combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL), but I have progressively felt the need to increase the dose.

Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen?

Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? (I have known that this medicine can increase seizure risk when in high dose.)",3, been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more
I don't know what is happening to my mind. I have got 3 panic attacks in the last 5 days. Everything is getting messed up. Things are going downhill at my home. I can't sleep at night now for the shoutings and all the fights. I can't study even though exams are coming. My soul love just got engaged to someone else and I have to see tgose the moment I step out of my house as he is my neighbour. I always wanted to go abroad and make a living as a nurse. I am falling in my grades and all my former classmates are settling down overseas. My relatives hate me because I am bad at studies and a fat and ugly girl. I can't take this anymore. And also my depression is having a great time feeding over my faliures!!,3,panic attacks
"I really don't know where to start, I've never been someone to shy away from sharing my feelings, but for some reason sharing my feelings with people irl right now just doesn't seem to help any more, so I'm hoping for some kind of release or anything by sharing how I feel on this sub.. I just wanna preface by saying that I'm going to talk about 3 different girls in my life, 2 of which are integral to this, (A and B), however I want to say I'm not depressed because of girls, I wouldn't be posting here if it was just about heartbreak (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't want people to get that imoression from this)

I've suffered from depression off/on since I was about 15, so it's been 8 almost 9 years. By off/on I mean it has hills and valleys, it's always kind of there, but at the same time kind of can go away? I don't know if that makes much sense.. right now, and definitely for the past 6 months, it's the longest time I've ever spent at the bottom of a valley, and it also happens to be one of the deepest I've ever been down. 

I'm definitely an ugly duckling story. A lot of my depression started originally as an awkward teen, I had long emo hair, I was very skinny and always have been, I was shy, had very bad social anxiety to the point I would vomit all the time, even when at school and going out with friends. I never liked the town I grew up in, people knew me to be a certain way or thing, that when I tried to change it just didn't work.. 

Fast forward from when I was 15 and when I finally moved out and went to college, at 18, I had truly 'blossomed'. I looked good. And for my 4 years at college I slayed. I've been with over 100 women, spent my nights going out partying, spending all my time with friends.. everything went away, my anxiety, my depression and my awkwardness. 

During that time however, I experienced an emotionally abusive relationship with girl A (protecting names).. this was in the early days, and she amplified all my problems tenfold (until I finally escaped and my mental health improved).

I met the girl of my dreams (at the time) when I was 20, and things were great until it ended, which sent me in to a spiral of sleeping with so many women to block out my feelings, I drank a shit tonne, I even did drugs (I'm not proud of it, and it was completely against character, I regret it deeply, but I'm just glad I wasn't hurt nor did I hurt anyone else during that time). This continued for a few months, and I finished college, jumped from job to job and had no clue where my life was going.. 

Then I met B. I met her just before I turned 22, and it was the best thing that's ever happened to me. She took away my pain and gave me help and support to steady myself in a way that nobody else ever had. I was so shut off from feelings and shut off from wanting to show emotion, that it took her a while for me to get me out of my cage that I had locked myself if.. but it was great, and I will always appreciate her for that... 

I moved home from Aberdeen where I had been to do college, due to a failed business attempt, and my flatmate was moving away too. B was staying in Aberdeen, and we decided on a ""long distance"" relationship. And it was fine, no problems whatsoever. I only lived a couple hours away on the train, so I saw her basically every weekend. Whilst home I started working with my dad, and just wanted to save money up. 

One day, girl A messaged me.. I didn't want anything to do with her but B told me to forgive her and be friends.. I guess she was just too trusting. I decided to tell A I forgive her and we can be friends, but I never messaged her or anything and was just polite when she messaged me, but in all I left her alone.. This is the part that makes my blood boil, and makes my heart ache.. B and I fell out over a friend she had trying to say shit about me.. (she hated me, and I had no reason why).. that night I messaged A and we had deep chats and one thing lead to another and flirtatious texts were sent and a couple photos. I felt horrible. And I stupidly kept it a secret.. this all happened in January or last year.. and then in June of last year, girl A told girl B everything, as I had deleted and blocked A out of my life and she didn't like that... I have no clue what sparked it.. my only regret is I wasn't considerate and honest enough to tell B about what I did... 

Flash forward to today and I'm alone.. and have been since June. And this brings me to how I currently feel, and why I'm frustrated with where I'm at.. obviously going through college taught me how to break out of my depression, and I've been trying to follow it but... Nothings working and has started revealing more problems.. 

If you've made it this far then thank you so much. There's not much more to read. 

I feel now lost more than ever. I've been going to the gym constantly almost every day for the past 4 months, to stay healthy and hoping it would keep me busy. I've gained weight, and physically I feel incredible. I've gone from 9st 9lbs to 11st and I feel I've finally escaped skinny me and all the people that made fun of my for looking like a rake (girl A). But it's not helped how I feel in my head.. 

I don't feel connected to my friends anymore, they've all moved away and I rarely get to see them, and most messaged go unanswered for days because they're busy.. I only have one friend that still lives in my town, and it pains me to say but I feel like the relationship isn't what it once was, and that we've gone on different paths, so it just feels awkward when I see him, however I do try to keep it going because I know isolation KILLS. 

I spend time with my family a lot, I love my family and they're very supportive and understand how I feel. However it just doesn't feel the same as hanging out with friends, and I find myself getting frustrated being around them a lot, even though they've shown me nothing but love, and it makes me feel even more awful feeling that way.

I've thrown myself in to further studies and with work. I'm studying accounting niw to keep busy, and I work hard at my job to keep busy and give me money. I spend all my time working, studying, gyming, hanging out with family, and trying to see friends, so my life is full, but my heart just feels empty. I feel like I'm rotting from the inside.. 

I also don't connect with any of the things that once we're a great pastime for me.. video games just aren't the same as they were, I don't connect to any of the nerdy shit I used to like and I don't know what else to be interested in.. 

And finally.. I miss girl B. I no longer contact her, as I know she hates me for betraying her. I know she's getting on with her life, new man, working hard, all that.. I've deleted and blocked her from everything and haven't looked to see what she's up to (I just know what she's up to due to a friend telling me without me asking which felt like a fucking knife..). The old 20 year old me wants to hook up with girls and ""get under someone to get over someone"" but, I can't. My head and heart won't let me. I've tried meeting up with a couple girls but I just can't get in to it at all, and I have no desire to be with them.. 

Just to put a cherry on top the ice cream, girl A is now dating a friend who lives back in Aberdeen, so I've decided to cut him out of my life.. because I can't have any connection to girl A.. that's done a lot of horrible things to me in my life. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense at all, or if I even deserve to be posting here.. I'm working hard, going to gym, even seeing a therapist, keeping busy as all hell.. but still I feel so numb inside and wake up crying at night, unable to get my head and heart to agree to keep looking to the future..

"Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram  (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out.  I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug? Thanks 

TLDR: Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa, any positive experiences to ease my worry? ",3,Scared of the sexual side effects of Celexa
"Hey guys, so this might be a little long but I'll put a tl:dr at the end.

I've had depression ranging from severe to moderate (depending on the month tbh) for the past couple of years along with social/general anxiety, kickstarted by the loss of my dad and made worse through by going through college with 0 friends and having absolutely nothing social to do. Last year I went to a psychiatrist who put me on Paxil, told me it'd do away with both my depression and anxiety and gave me a bunch of BS advice about how to make friends and the like (common sense type stuff I already know and try). Well after a month of Paxil I kinda turned into a different person, my anxiety was completely gone but my depression was through the roof, leading to me making a LOT of bad decisions. I went back to my psychiatrist telling him that I didn't think it was helping my depression, and he said that's normal and upped my dose from 20mg to 30mg. This made everything WAY worse; I felt like I was slightly drunk all the time (only comparison I can think of), and my inhibitions were like always gone. I started smoking cigarettes, hiring escorts, getting in fights with people for no reason, just crazy shit I NEVER would have done before. My general anxiety came back and then some, I started having panic attacks almost daily, hobby's I used to love just seemed worthless and boring, it just made everything I took it to prevent worse. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but on Paxil they were daily. It culminated in my roommates having an intervention with me telling and reminding me of everything I'd done and just how much more of a miserable asshole I'd become. So I stopped taking the Paxil (those brain zaps were fun) and went back to my psychiatrist explaining all of this to him, and he told me it had nothing to do with the Paxil and I just wasn't following his advice (which consisted of ""talk to people"", ""you don't need friends in college"", ""girls will like you when you have a successful career in the future"").

Since being off the Paxil I have gone back to my old self, my roommates and my family have both told me I seem back to normal, I feel like I used to, I can enjoy video games and fishing again, but I'm still just as depressed and anxious as I was before the Paxil (plus now I'm hooked on cigarettes, so thanks for that Paxil). I went to my primary care doctor last week and explained all of this to him, and he recommended I see a psychologist, and gave me a script for 25mg Zoloft and .5mg Klonopin. I'm working on finding a psycologist at the moment, and the Klonopin helps a lot with my anxiety (though I know it's a benzo and not a long term solution), but I'm literally terrified to start Zoloft. I don't want to go through another experience like Paxil, I can say without a doubt that those 5 months were the worst most shameful and miserable of my life. So, with all that said, does anyone know if Zoloft is likely to cause this misery again? Or really does anyone just have any advice for me? I feel like I'm in a pit and everything they give you just digs the pit even deeper, I just need some advice.

TL:DR - Was prescribed Paxil for 5 months, turned me into a monster and made me feel absolutely terrible. Now have a 25mg Zoloft perscription and am terrified of what's gonna happen when I take it.

I can barely talk to anyone, there's a barrier of thoughts, feelings and behaviours in my head and it makes me feel depressed all the time. CBT seems like it would help me so much, but I have no energy or focus or bother to stick with it or believe in it.

 I don't want medication to be a crutch. I want it to be a stepping stone up. I know I can be okay. I'm already somewhat half-okay, I'm on the right track, I just need to be able to change a few core behaviours and thoughts. On paper, medication would help with this. But the more I read, the more shit-scared I get. Seems like there's almost nothing but negative experiences online. Side effects, people literally becoming dumber/having cognitive impairment, people losing sexual function for months, years, sometimes forever, SSRIs being glorified placebos with side effects, heroin-like withdrawals, people tapering off and having their depression/anxiety later come back doubled, etc. It all just seems like some impossible insidious trap. The more I read the more I almost cannot believe these are prescribed.

 I'm not trying to be a fear-monger here. I've read some best-case scenarios of people going on medication, switching across a few until they found one without side effects, staying on it for only a few months or years until things were better, then slowly stepping off them and continuing to be okay, using the techniques and habits they built while on medication. Maybe all the bad things I've read are because people experiencing negative effects are more likely to be on reddit telling others about it. But there's just a sea of negative experiences, side effects and anecdotes out there which are impossible to ignore.

"Wall of text. Feel free to skip. I should say my psychiatrist did his fellowship at Johns Hopkins, the best medical school, and the ECT head went to Stanford and is certified in ect and connected to the (well-respected medical) university here (Tampa)

I have been diagnosed variously schizophrenia /schizoaffective /and even bipolar. I was in a psych ward and left for dead pretty much at 18, recovered completely after detox from a crazy psych cocktail, got B. A, M. A. even taught abroad. Had a very stressful illness in a minor city in China and whatever medicine given either caused or exacerbated some delusional thinking. But I recovered in a major Chinese city on what I assume was sedatives. When I got back to the US I couldn't sleep and eventually went on the antipsychotic paliperidone and klonopin after trying various medicines including trazodone and got a job teaching English as a second language at a university , but decided to go off the antipsychotic , which went poorly as heavy depression set in again sparked by illness followed by psychosis and hospitalization twice, both psychosis remitting after a few days. Stayed on the paliperidone. 

Flash forward to this fall. Eventually decided I'd had enough of the inhuman feeling of paliperidone, I became ridiculously depressed and was having issues with my body freezing in place and moving in genral. One medicine (memantine) I took made me suicidal to the extent that i was arrested and involuntarily held in a hospital that my neurologist had suggested I get ect in if Ativan didn't work. (he also diagnosed multifocal dystonia and catatonia, which the catatonia the psychiatrists didn't seem to agree with) 

I was lucky because psychotic depression set in mildly after a few days in the psych ward but no one noticed and the next day I had ect. Been through four sessions since. After the first, the suicidality and inability to move much and psychotic depression went away, and, eventually, after a few weeks, I began to feel a sense of happiness for the first time in at least ten years  

I've tried and has bad reactions to pretty much every atypical antipsychotic on the market, and been shot with Haldol at least 4 times. Also tried pristiq and wellbutrin with suicidal thoughts as side effects for the first one and clonus for the second, which I thought may have to do with serotonin syndrome

"I'm feeling pretty bad most of the time lately.

I have my ups and downs like every normal person but I feel 'down' 90/95% of the time. I dont think this is healthy.

Lately every morning when I wake up I have this ANNOYING tingly feeling in my intensities. The same feeling you get when you're weightless (freefalling).

Also, I have a very negative thought pattern. I always look back on events (doesnt matter how small or big) and think negatively, or how it impacts me in a negative manner. This is also a very big part of my social anxiety. I always look back and think about the shit that makes me appear fucked-up instead of the things that make me appear awesome. 

I cant get out of bed easily, I avoid most social situations, I smoke weed daily and cant stop, I take drugs (one or a combo of the following: alcohol/ghb/2cb/nitrous/speed/4fmp/xtc/mdma/cocaine/ketamine) every weekend, I cant get a girlfriend because of my anxiety while my friends and siblings can, Even the fucking gym doesnt really
help either because I cant gain more muscle mass after my plateau. (Workout for 2.5 years, first year gained like 43 pounds while staying low bodyfat in the 1.5years, but stayed the same last full year eventhough I put in as much work as I always did)

All of this is making me incredibly sad. The drugs are the only fun thing I do. And video games occasionally but they dont entertain me as much as they did 2/3 years back.

Im 19 years old and I am thinking about calling a psychologist monday morning next week. Mainly because of my social anxiety and anger attacks (another emotionally-selfdestructive problem of mine), but I feel like I am slipping into a depression aswel. Any thoughts?

As my title says, depression has ruined my life. I've just broken up with my fianc√© because she found out I cheated on her. I know that makes me pure scum but it's made me realise how much I'm struggling to cope with life and that I need (and am getting) help. 

I've bottled up my depression for years which lead to ""episodes"". These ranged from assaults (which lead to nights in the cells), drug abuse, alcohol abuse, fits of anger, compulsive lying, erratic behaviour, and, at my lowest, cheating. Each of these came with extreme lows and ever increasing suicidal thoughts. I realised something needed to change soon or I would end it - it was that simple. 

It was my ex that told me to get help. It was my mum that came with me to my first counselling session (2nd one later this week) and to the GP (doctor). Both of these experiences were terrifying but extremely helpful. The GP is going to be putting me on antidepressants as he explained that I needed help with the low feelings I was having. I go back tomorrow once the GP has checked that a previous medical condition won't affect my treatment. 

I'm not sure I'm going to get through this as I'm still thinking about suicide almost every hour, but I'm going to try. I'm not willing to throw away the best 5 years of my life for nothing and I hope when I get better that I can try and rekindle my relationship and give my perfect girl the life she deserves. 

If anyone else is in a dark place right now please reach out to someone - a family member, a friend, a counsellor, a doctor, anyone that can give you the support you need.

"The past few years I've been going through some mental health changes that have become quite alarming. I was feeling generally down and had tried to combat it with exercise, surrounding myself with positivity, trying new hobbies, etc. Slowly things started to change, I was becoming anxious around crowds, I'd get flustered in grocery stores when crowded, started feeling like I wanted to avoid the gym because of people, crying became a regular thing and my family's life started to revolve around if I was going to get triggered by something negative which would send me into a spiral of sadness or anger. This is not typical of me and I'm watching it unravel in front of me. I feel crazy! I started getting into these fogs, nothing seemed to be as exciting as they should be to me, go to an amusement park? Get new camera equipment? Go hiking? I love those things but all of a sudden it just felt like they were happening around me and I was just there, just experiencing it, and it didn't feel good to me the way it should. Suicidal thoughts always accompanied my bouts of sadness, so I decided to get some help.

I went to see a counselor about how I was feeling. It was my first attempt to reach out and it went awful. Firstly, I should have mentioned that I had suicidal thoughts, but I didn't as I was ashamed of it, felt like it made me weak or that it would sound extreme. The councelor told me to stop pestering my family and that regardless if I went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me in with their schedule and that I'd probably only get seen for 30 minutes at a time. I left feeling defeated and tried to use that to motivate myself to beat this on my own.

The past 6 months things have gotten worse. I was alarmed that one day I started feeling tired, like I was just done with ""feeling"" and wanted to die. It felt so casual to me to think that I wanted to electrocute myself in the bathtub and that it felt relieving to see a way to end this overwhelming feeling. I told my spouse to help me because I'm about to kill myself and I don't want to die, but I desperately hate this overwhelming whiplash.

We agree to try getting help again, but I put it off thinking I can try again to defeat it myself. Now, I've started getting panic attacks at the slightest hint of stress. It's like my brain is breaking. I start to hyperventilate and struggle to breathe. I've been getting sent into emotional spirals more often and again, I started thinking if I took some pain pills I could slit my throat in the bathtub.

My appointment is in a few days and I'm really nervous. I'm really sad about it because I feel like I'm crazy. I know that other doctor was wrong, but I'm afraid if this new doctor will be the same. I'm struggling so hard and I can't help myself anymore. I want to get help and I feel like I'm crazy that this is all happening because it's not me. I don't want to be like this and I don't want to have to live like this, in fear of my own self and getting triggered into sadness or hopelessness.

I don't want to self diagnose, but I think something is wrong with me. This is definitely not normal to me.

TL;DR: Can you give any tips as to handle talking to my doctor about all this? What do I say, what is important to mention?",3,"went to therapy or took meds, they wouldn't work. That medication wouldn't work and that their therapist wouldn't have time to fit me"

"I used to lead a successful life and was proud of how simple and easy my life had turned into, and I believed that my purpose in life was to show everyone around me how to live successfully without disrespecting anyone or any rules and without cutting corners.  In essence I felt that I held the key to happiness and was eager to share it with anyone who was willing to follow my example.

Unfortunately, 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma, and was totally unprepared for that even though it was highly likely to happen during my lifetime.  At the beginning I was positive about the whole situation, so I went to a blind rehabilitation center thinking that after coming out I would pick up where I left and continue to be an example to others, but I totally underestimated the mental drag that comes with being blind.  I started seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist shortly after going blind, and in 4 years I had 3 psychologists and 2 psychiatrists tel me that I show no signs of clinical depression beyond wanting to die, so I'm not taking any meds.

The problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag that makes everything extremely unpleasant to do, and I know that these problems aren't going away as there is absolutely nothing I or anyone else can do to return my life to what it was.  I'm also no longer an example to anyone as I have become extremely dependent, not because I don't want to do things but rather because I refuse to accept that I'm blind and have to do them differently, so the only way I see out of this is killing myself, but even that becomes much harder to do blind.",3," 4 years ago I went blind due to a congenital glaucoma,problem is that my life is no longer simple like before, as the strategies required to live blind make even the smallest problems a challenge to solve thus creating a huge mental drag"
"Recently I received some bad news at home ‚Äî another health issue one would think would never impact me, even indirectly.  I don‚Äôt want to get into those details, but it led me to decide I needed to stop medication because my ‚Äúluck‚Äù is so bad no matter how good the medication I am still going to endure an incessant stream of negative events and circumstances that will overwhelm me.

"I created this account to seek advice as I would prefer to protect the privacy of my wife and her brother - don't mind the vast emptiness of my post history. If this is the wrong place to post this or if someone knows a better sub, please let me know and I will remove / x-post as needed.

I have tried to assist my brother-in-law over the course of three years in a multitude of ways but I am not sure if there will ever be anything that can truly be ""done"" for him - thus I am reaching out to see if anyone has a different take on it all. Obviously there will be big chuncks of information that will be omitted due to space / time / privacy / etc reasons but I'll try to express everything the best I can. My background is homeless youth (troubled home, graduated high school late, etc) and then military service for nearly a decade, 37 yrs old now.

My brother-in-law (Let's call him BIL or BILL for short) was under the care of a psychaiastrist from the age of 12 to 28 yrs old (when the doctor retired). This psychiastrist medicated Bill with Adderall and clonazepam under the diagnosis of depression and ADHD. When Bill talks to me about this doctor he readily admits that he thinks the relationship had crossed the line between doctor-patient and that the doctor probably prescribed whatever Bill wanted.

From what I have been told from Bill's mom, dad and siblings, and Bill himself, Bill was a smart kid but wasn't someone who had any particular interest (no chess team, choir, sports, etc) and was pretty anti-social. Bill started drinking around age 16 as he felt him fit in.

Bill graduated from his very religious school and upbringing on time. He went into a custodial position right after HS and went to college for a portion of a year but dropped out. From that point forward, Bill lived with girlfriends and could hold a  job for about a fifth of a year up until I met the family. I emplyed Bill for about a year where I found that he was a hard worker but he required (I mean literally) constant supervision and instruction. Bill is not an idiot. I want to be clear about this. Bill is obviously an intelligent man who has a lot of potentional. With that said, he doesn't seem to have the ability to link the multiple steps from the beginning of a problem to the conclusion of the fix. Think about if I asked you to install a toilet - most of us, if we did not know what to do, would look up a video or read the instructions that were included. Bill would instead plan a large and very complicated process that would end up consuming an entire day without Bill being able to really explain what he did all day and why the toilet wasn't installed. However, if I explained the process up front or told Bill to look up a video, the task would get completed well and with quality. Bill has been pretty blunt in our conversations in that he says he has never paid a single dollar towards any rent in his life.

Bill expresses deep depression often, self-harms (and tells me that it's only for attention) and will actively sabotage any efforts to assist him. A good example is that he will discuss the desire to move into a support house so he can be around others going through this. He will make appointments, will ask me for a ride (where I will take time off work) and then on the day of the appointment, will reschedule the event (key point here that I didn't say ""cancel the event"") and proceed to get smashed drunk. I only find out after I have driven an hour and a half to pick him up that he is passed out drunk on his mom's sofa.

So that is Bill in a nutshell.

Bill's mother was, by my defination, an enabler to the extreme. She acted completely dumbfounded each and everytime Bill is drunk / quits a job / gets arrested / etc. She will take even the most obvious lies he spins as facts. I had been around for when Bill would tell her, slurring words and stumbling, that he isn't drunk and she would believe him, chalking it up to ""Bill must be tired"". This continued all the way up until earlier this year when she realized that if she kept cleaning up after him, he would kill himself (driving drunk, alcohol poisioning, self harm that went wrong). We have paid for Bill to go through five rehabs over the last 3 years and used state rehabs twice as we no longer have the funds for private help. Bill's girlfriend finally got tired of everything and booted him out. He moved in with his mother until recently when the local PD had arrested Bill six times in two weeks for PIs and trespassing. At that point we took him to a state rehab in Fort Worth, Tx to try yet again.

Bill finished the rehab about a month ago, got drunk and is now living homeless in the FTW area. He keeps in touch regulary (I cover his phone expenses, provided him with cold weather gear, shelter info, and visit him weekly). He has been hospitalized twice for alcohol poisoning over teh last month but still refuses to follow-up on the resources that are offered to him. I was tehre for both ER stays (both turned into 3-4 day in-patient stays) where the nurses and doctors offered him help but he never showed up to any of the follow-up visits. Bill's entire family ahs told him many, many times that we are all here for him.

I care about Bill but the most painful part of all this (for me) is I see how much of a toll this takes on my wife. She is a recovering addict (4 years sober!) and she has an intimate understanding of the pain and physical harm that can evolve from Bill's situation. I have spent many nights going to NAR-Anon groups trying to learn to be as supportative as I can for my wife but with Bill, I honestly have no idea what else I have to offer. My wife has remained sober as she makes that choice every single morning to be sober.

I guess after writing all this I have a fairly simple question for a very complicated situation - Can someone tell me stories about what has helped others / themselves in the past that might have seen any of this?

I know there are some folks out there that can't be helped. Others still can be helped but only they can start the process. If we can't help Bill, what can I say to the family to help (as much as is possible in this situation)?

Thanks for anyone's time who reads this and thanks even more for anyone who has even the slightest advice for us to help Bill.

I have drawn the longer of the sticks, because unlike my mother and my sister I don't live at home so I only see him a few times a week, when they have to deal with his abuse everyday. 

I do what I can to be a support for them, I've always been a person who could be strong for another person (especially my mom). She leans on me with all her problems (financial and mental) mostly dealing with her depression that stem back to losing her own mom. It doesn't bother me when she calls me sad because usually she just needs to vent and everything is ok. 

But now its different

One, it's not just my mom calling it's my sister also, who I have never had to worry about because she is a mentally strong person, but now I feel my dad is breaking her down and she isn't strong enough to deal with my dad and be the shoulder for my mom who is starting to spiral. Two, my mom will not seek help (even though she has in the past), and my sister mentioned she has been making suicidal comments (which I'm not sure if she did that when she first dealt with depression, I was pretty young and don't remember). 

We are a fairly poor family who has managed to get by, but it's not like we can afford a psychologist. Which is part of the reason I have taken the role of being the person everyone in the family vents to. 

So I guess what I'm asking the reddit community if anyone takes the time to read all this is....

1. Has anyone dealt with a stroke victim like this before and how did they handle it.
2. How do I keep my younger sister sane when she means so much to me, and I hate to see her fall into depression like my mom has in the past
3. How do I get my mom to seek whatever help is out there, and are there any freeish psychs out there that help people who are in a deep state of depression.
4. How do I try to stay strong when my entire family is falling apart and I feel so helpless and scared.

Sorry for the probably million misspellings, it's been a long day and I'm tired. 

Thanks to anybody who has been through something similiar and can possibly help. Part of this might just be I needed to vent, and had no one to turn to. Thanks to reddit, when you can't turn to anyone now you can turn to everyone.

P.S. if you are a depressed person seak help, it's not selfish, it's not just sadness, it's a disease. ",3,"my dad had his stroke...physically he came out fine, but mentally not so much.

"SO I have struggled with clinical depression my entire life, and I see a psychaitrist/therapist, and I talk with my therapist and something I struggle with the most is I can be hard on myself/expect a lot of out myself, and always feel overwhelming guilty, or like a failure, or worthless, or disgusting when I don't do something right or make a mistake. And I don't know if what happened this time is one of those cases where I am being too hard on myself or if I should feel horrible and guilty.

So I also do drink with friends usually once a week or so (at a bar, friends house, or my place), but I know how dangerous it can be to drink with depression and sometimes I have gotten too drunk so I really try to be conscious and drink responsibly when I do. And last night I had like 5 friends over for a girl's night, and we all drank and had fun drunk talk until like 5am, and it was really great and fun and I think I drank just the right amount (enough to have a good time but not enough to go overboard), but at the very end of the night I guess I had one last drink too many because the last hour of the night is fuzzy (like I kind of remember the last hour but not fully)....and I didn't do anything bad or embarassing in regards to hanging out with my friends, but when I woke up (and this is what I feel disgusting and guilty about) I discovered I wet the bed!!! And i feel horrible and disgusting that I let myself drink that much again that I fucking wet the bed? like i feed so ashamed and horrible and gross and disgusting. and im so sad becase it was a really great and fun night otherwise but i feel like this ruins the entire memory too because i just feel so ashamed and guilty and disgusting. Like even being able to type this out was hard because I feel so horrible and ashamed. And I live with my husband and I made sure to clean it up so he wouldn't find out and not even tell him because I felt so ashamed (I ended up falling asleep on the guest bed in a different room than him where me and my friends were hanging out)


and all day ive felt absolutely horrible and gross and disgusting and ashamed. and i dont know if i should ever even trust myself to drink again after i did something so horrible??? And am I just being too hard on myself, or should I feel this bad and was what I did that disgusting and horrible? And should I even trust myself to drink with friends anymore after that?

"Hello!

Long time lurker, first time poster. In the interest of staying alive until my new dosage of medication kicks in (and hopefully works), my therapist suggested I stay distracted.

"Hey People of Reddit,

I don't know if Im actually depressed, but I may be depressed at times and I feel like I could do so much with life but I can't.


Quick list of my issues :
First off the weed/hash issue.
Im addicted to this shit. I don't do it socially I do it at home at my computer mostly because im a big computer tech geek person. I get high and enjoy my time alone just doing nothing but shit..the thc makes nothing great. 
weed is my biggest life killer...I skipped high school so much in my life and had crazy allergies and always felt sick so I kind of fucked up my education only to realise in my mid 20s that Im allergic to weed and it makes me have a runny nose the next day and itchy eyes and I have asthma so I breath badly when i smoke a lot in the next couple days and get bloated and just feel so shitty.. so that fucked with my education..im 28 now. I think it fucked my social life too and Iv know this for a couple years and I don't wanna smoke but i just cant stop I hate myself its a real addiction. It makes me not wanna hang with people or go in public due to paranoid thoughts. It fucks up my motivation and ambition and i just work in a call center ( which im a top seller at ) but its such a low income and low ambition job.

I don't have many friends and I honestly hate a lot of people , in my experience I don't meet or attract cool people at all. 

I have a gf and shes so cool and so like me..shes a little bit of a problem drinker and weve been together for 3 years and have had our ups and downs. 

Im a 5'11 wide guy with muscles..I should weigh 200 but i weigh 250 and its a drag and im self conscious about my tummy even if it isnt huge but its still a fat tummy. I have issues with my knees and back ( ashritis since im 15 and medication doesnt really help much anymore ).

I used to play hockey a lot and with the boys we would go out and shit it was a good way of having friends who are men in my life but since the past 3 years iv torn my groin ( sports hernia ) twice which will have you not doing sports for about a year every time you tear it. Hockey was my life and its fucking gone and I feel like it will tear again.

On top of that i sweat a lot...even when i was 210 lbs I was sweating a lot..mostly my back and my head so my hair gets drenched walking a couple blocks and then my back sweats and it drips down into my boxers and i just gotta wear black cloths or if i sit on my ass theyll be a sweat stain.. its a huge thing in my life and it affects me very much in a lot of situations, lets just say im the only guy at work with a fan and I overheat very easily a lot..even in -20 weather if i walk like 3 blocks ill get home sweaty and im just always like wtf...imagine in +20 weather how bad it can be..I wear the same shirt and cloths almost everyday that dry up quick and are dark colors...

My gf is great she doesnt mind the sweat she is a special girl, im surprised i even have a gf like wtf. altho she has issues similiar to me i can understand how we are in eachothers life still...having a girl in ur life can be great and can also be the shittiest thing ever but once you go there you never can go back to being single.

I don't know im just looking for words of wisdom and advice maybe,..I know i don't have it as bad as some people here.. I have a good family but i avoid them...i don't rly like my dad but hes in my life and my parents divorced when i was 1 year old I think...he cheated on her and tried to fuck with her during my childhood and all kinds of fucked up shit...

Im def stuck in my comfort bubble. All I wanna do is either become an actor ( fuck theyll stop the scene and be like can you not sweat sir during the scene ) or become a rapper/sound designer but that shit involves connecting with people who just never seem interested and everyone wants to do their own thing nowadays and I feel i need a mentor for this so its hard.

I could go on and I feel i can't even explain the real issues in my life in this post.

Any advice/words of wisdom?

"I live with my two cousins (sisters A &amp; B). One cousin I'm cool with, A. I used to live with her and just moved out due to me needing a closer house to my job so now I live with B. I've been struggling with depression most of my life but I hadn't really accepted it. To me I was raised that being depressed or bipolar or whatever is just an excuse and that I should just be normal. I have a habit of just eating everything so B confronts me about it when we go to Wal-Mart. Makes a huge lecture in the car about how ""I'm eating everything and what is wrong with me"". She's not lying so I just start thinking, *is this really how my life is going?* On the drive home, I was quiet and A took notice but dismissed it. This was two days ago.

Earlier at A's house, A and I were in the kitchen and I started talking about how I felt. B was at work. Then the conversation went to me talking about what made me sad. How I feel like I suck the joy out of others. And how I saw a video about how one guy wanted to end it, so he's basically just eating himself to death. I told her that I feel like maybe I'm doing that too.... Eating to fill a void.... I told her how I miss my family (I moved out of my dads house and he's on the other side of the country so I can't just go down the street) and how I just am generally sad, dropping out of college, etc. How eating makes me forget how I feel and I feel at peace. How I'm too scared to actually do anything so I feel like I might just be letting nature take its course. 

Her face scared me. I never have told anyone about how I felt, except for y'all. (I post sometimes.) Her face just looked like I had told her I murdered puppies or something. Part of me hated that I told her, that I was weak. But another part, and the reason I post this, feels free. I feel good that someone knows. I don't feel alone. 

She's gonna help me lose weight and focus on music to try to find something meaningful in life. I feel good. I accept that I do suffer from depression. I was diagnosed before but as I said I didn't take it seriously.

"I got out of the psych ward after a two week stay just a few days ago. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder, but I don't know how accurate the diagnosis could be given that I have the tendency to act accordingly to avoid certain diagnosis. My mother keeps trying to label me as a psychopath or sociopath, or a borderline. Mainly because I don't love her, I don't necessarily care about her or my brother. I think about them dying a lot, but I wouldn't kill them or anyone. I just know that I wouldn't particularly be upset if it happened, and that goes for most other members of my family.
I do have feelings for a few of my friends and partners, boyfriends or friends with benefits but I can't picture losing them like I can my parents. Maybe I'm too self absorbed but I really don't know.
My IQ is 108 so I don't think I could be a sociopath given that they usually are much smarter than the average person. A psychopath I don't know either but I really don't want to diagnose myself with anything, I'd hate to label myself as that kind of person.
I used to be a Christian. I was reading an old journal a few days ago, from eighth and ninth grade. I had written out a prayer, angrily question God as to why he allowed me to be born without the capacity to love my family.
I've never been suicidal, or tried to hurt myself past a certain extent. It seems like every emotion I do have is stronger to me than it would be the average person, I don't know why. It's hard for me to empathize with most people.
Based on experience or general knowledge from a third party, what are the possibilities that my mother is right about me? Is this regular teenage angst? I'm nearly seventeen.

"Hi guys,
Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous.

Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3.
In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..)

I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business.
I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this.

(M/24/Appalachia)
Been depressed for over a decade now, and every year it's gotten worse. I feel like I am the subject of some cruel joke, a demented Truman Show, just tortured constantly in every aspect of life. Even the simplest tasks that people do, I have problems with. 



I am quite ill and have severe chronic pain (FAPs), but I can't get help because I live in the south and only junkies are allowed pain medicine here now with the new laws, and plus ""I'm too young to be so sick!"". I'm also a student but every year I fail half of my classes due to my illness or my severe crippling anxiety. The exhaustion is constant, and I don't have the mental or physical energy to do anything. I can't work either due to the same issues so I have no income, don't even have a bank account because I can't afford it. What money I do get I spend on cannabis for pain relief and so that I can keep food down (FGID). The pain really is crippling and I'm in tears from it 3+ times a day. I've waited 9 hrs in the ER, and I was still not seen by a doc. That's ""coal country"" for you, raped by corporations and then left to rot (//soapboxing)



I sleep about 3 or 4 nights out of the week (~4 hrs nightly), and have gone 6 days without sleep. Right now I'm on day 2. The sleep is never restful, I wake up about once an hour, the extreme pain creates these violent dreams where I am constantly getting brutally murdered. Takes me at least 3 hours to fall asleep, and I've spent 12+ hours laying awake in bed trying to sleep (I think that's why my joints hurt so bad.)



My psych is useless, he literally won't let me finish a single sentence and constantly berates me. He also refuses to treat me unless I take Paxil (his biggest sponsor) which previously led me to a suicide attempt and almost got me expelled from school (they thought I was on hard drugs). My psych didn't even have record of this suicide attempt even though I told them about it immediately. I've tried all the SSRI's and SNRI's and they all leave me worse than when I came in. I want to keep living and I'm afraid these meds will ensure that I don't. Sadly I can't switch doc's because the state pharmacy board will say I'm Dr. Shopping, being in WV they take it seriously. All of this together makes life like Chinese water torture. Drop by drop, day by day.



That's not even the worst of it, but I'll keep that one to myself for now or else some of you may think suicide *IS* a valid option for me! This event really gives me symptoms of PTSD though, but I don't self diagnose, and it puts a heavy load of regret on me I carry every day. Another deep regret I carry is from this: My good friend left from my house to a planned fight, which ended in my good friend using self defense and shot one of the men who was attacking. My friend just got 10 years for it, and I have so much weight on my heart that if I could have just stopped my friend from leaving he would still be free and this victim would still be alive. I think about it everyday. It really is torture in this poor tiny mountain town. This is as close to a 3rd world country in the US as it gets.

 

Socially I'm just as bad, heavily introverted. College is hell, I go to a small local campus of a bigger uni, meaning the class size is small. Forced participation is a nightmare, and there are no worse words to me than: ""Ok everyone, find a partner"" I end up alone every time. My every cough, every lead pencil broken, every sniff of the nose sends a wave a pure cringe through my body, even though I know it doesn't matter and no one cares. My anxiety gets so bad I have to leave class to puke, yet my psych sees no issues there. I find my self tailing friends at bars and if they leave I'm quietly in the corner awaiting their return. Comedy is my only crutch because physically I'm monstrous and have no self-esteem or confidence, I literally look like I have 2 black eyes ALL THE TIME. Tried all the creams and stuff but it's beyond help I think.



I don't expect anyone to have some magic solution but at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. I don't remember what it's like to be happy, and I'm forgetting what it's like to be human as well. Thanks for listening it really means the world to me.



Positives: I have an apartment w/ no rent, I'm good enough comedian to have a YT channel. Play guitar fairly well. Compassionate and empathetic to the point where it screws me over. Great w/ kids (studying Elementry Ed., no anxiety towards the kids, but if an adult is there too the anxiey is through the roof) I also don't really get social anxiety when streaming on Twitch (unless I've had a little too much ganja) perhaps the the screen being a barrier that blocks some of the anxiety, who knows.


Sorry for the novel, that's adderall for ya.

"Hey. Excuse my incoming rant, I just feel like I have to get a few things off my chest or they will crush me for good and I have never done this before. Also excuse my English - I am prone to not paying attention to the grammar when I get long-winded.

What a year this was. Well, not for me but for pretty much everyone else I know. Success just can't stop coming for them. Pretty much everyone is doing great, even the people about which I used to think that they would end up in my current situation. And then there is me, in all of my useless, depressed self, wallowing in my self-inflicted misery. The only things that were enjoyable to me happened on a macro scale so they didn't really affect my personal actual situation at all.

I'm 24, still living with my parents and lonelier than ever before. I spend most of my days at home, mostly reading and watching useless crap on the internet. I read books too, but not as many as I used to. I've got attention issues. 10 years ago I could tear through a 600 pages long book in a day, today I can barely go for 15 minutes before I feel like I have to do something else (like refreshing a webpage and seeing that nothing has happened) and then have a hard time coming back to whatever I was doing. I can still read fast but I feel like I've become addicted to the ever-avaiable constant stream of shallow information that is so typical for this day and age - I think I know more the American electoral system now than I have ever wanted to know even though I live half a world away. Still, I've read pretty much through the entire Western canon over the last few years, trying to find answers... to anything with nothing coming out of it.

I procrastinate... a lot. It causes issues at the uni where I have been behind on pretty much every deadline I've ever gotten and considering what I've been told about my latest paper I may not even be able to finish it. But the degree I am trying to get is useless anyway (I chose it a few years ago in a bout of depression after I quit my original pursuit of some economics degree), so it probably doesn't matter anyway. The worst thing is that I think that I actually have a good work ethic when I really set my mind to something, but I hardly ever actually get to that point and I have a hard time staying in it because my mind just goes somewhere else. I've tried to write a book - I think I am pretty good with words, at least in my native language, and I thought it would offer me some more opportunities for escapism (that's pretty much the only peace I get these days). I got really excited, spend 3 weeks on it... and yet once I stopped some 30k words in, I have been having a hard time getting back, even though I have the whole thing in my head.

Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems. A doc told me two or three years ago that I should see a specialist because my thyroid apparently isn't working exactly as it should. I've ignored that advice and now I fear going to see a doctor because they will shit on me for neglecting the issue. I think it's just an irrational fear of criticism and denial. I know that I should do it and yet I can't bring myself to it. I've been delaying and delaying, always putting it in the ""after that"" spot. I am an idiot. Telling myself that I am an idiot does not really help though.

I've got communication issues too. Had them for a long time. I was bullied a bit at school when I was like 12 but while I thought for a longest time that it didn't affect me (I've become friends with all those people overtime), it probably ended up affecting me more than I thought it would. It certainly put a dent into my school performance, even though that was probably paired with the fact that I did not have learn anything for my first 6-7 years at school because all that stuff was too easy for me and so I never really learned how to learn, if you know what I mean.

The worst thing is that I feel like there is no reason for me to not live a normal life. I am clever... heck, my intelligence is well above average according to everything I have ever been told. I look normal - I think I have a pretty face, pretty green eyes and nice hair and all that. My height ended up average, close to 6 feet, even though my paediatrician has always said I'd turn out 5'5-6 at best. I am bit underweight and have problems putting on weight (thyroid again?), but that's probably the only issue with my appearance. I was surprised to discover that my voice is kinda whiny a few years ago, but I don't think it's that bad.

And yet I feel like I repulse people. I've never had a girlfriend. Those few girls I liked never... really paid attention to me, even though I was nice to them and they were nice to me... I should've probably been more assertive but I've always feared the embarassment of bad social experience. I've pretty much stopped trying over the years. Also, I don't remember any girl ever trying to get me and if any did, I remain completely blind to it to this day. As I said, I've eventually become friends with most people around me but those relationships were always pretty shallow. I've had maybe two really good friends over the last 10 years (mind you, hardly the ""best friend"" category) but even they have been gradually drifting out of my life. I can't really fault them for that as they have their own exciting lives and I have almost nothing to offer in exchange for friendship... they've certainly tried to get me out of my shell (and still do from time to time) and I will remain grateful for that.

Last summer I got a work in a warehouse. Just wanted to make some quick buck and I think manual job suits me because my mind can shut off and go to its own place without any consequences. I did the job well, all eager and active and got on a good raport with some co-workers. And yet after a few weeks they started telling me that there were no hours avaiable for me even though they told me there would be hours for several months when they hired me. Hell, they even hired more people after me and those were still coming to work. I've checked in a few more times after that and all I got were weird faces and evasive answers so I stopped. To this day I don't know what I did wrong. It's a small episode but it's pretty indicative of the rest of my life... I don't know what I did wrong and yet people never really connected with me on a deeper level so I drifted away from them as they did from me.

I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years. It's a real wonder that nobody ever got hurt. My mom's got anxiety and a phobia from dirt and diseases so she gets panic attacks basically all the time. It took my dad years to become mindful of that and the relationship has gone really sour over that time. Today they just fight over everything, even the smallest, stupidiest things, like who is going to cook a dinner. That has probably affected me too when it comes to interpersonal relationships... ""is this what I am going to get if I get a girlfriend? That's not worth it.""

I think I am getting to the end of this. I feel like I am missing some things I wanted to say, but I am glad that I've got at least this out of me. Happy New Year and let's hope the things get better.",3,"Those two issues are probably aided by thyroid problems.I should add that my parents fight a lot... have been fighting for 15 years.

"Throwaway because SO knows my username. 

I'm a graduate student in a field I've always wanted to be in, working with a world-renowned adviser; I have a supportive family, am relatively attractive and intelligent, and a great SO. By all accounts should be thrilled with the life I'm living. Obviously I'm not or I wouldn't be posting here. 

My motivation is basically gone, as is my confidence in myself and my passion for the work I'm doing. All I want to do is lie around and watch TV all day, and lately, that's all I've been able to do. My goal yesterday was to make it out of bed before 12 pm. 12 PM!!!! I'm an adult, that's ridiculous! 

I was a vegan for moral reasons for a long time, was a healthy eater, cooked nightly, and was in great shape from tons of yoga and working out. Now, I'm lucky if I do some light stretching and cook once a week.

I can't focus on anything. Trying to get work done is like running uphill in two feet of snow holding a bag of rocks. When I try to concentrate it feels like there is a cloud in my head that information can't get through. It's so frustrating and exhausting and I just can't handle it anymore. 

I've always had obsessive thoughts, and had a bit of OCD as a teenager, but now they're just constant and are affecting every aspect of my life. I know they're not rational, and I know not to let myself get fooled into believing them, but when I'm as vulnerable as I have been lately it's a challenge. 

It's taken me months to accept the fact that I might be depressed and not just a lazy, unmotivated pos, even though that's what I feel like. I've struggled with making excuses for myself and my behavior all my life; my mother rationalizes everything she does and never takes responsibility when she isn't handling things the way she should, and I think I've overcompensated in the wrong direction. This acceptance is a huge, painful step for me but I'm proud of myself for finally getting here. I think I need to accept that I need help and can't combat this alone. This isn't something to be ashamed of, it's something to confront head on and something the great, supportive people in my life can help me with.

"I was wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication, specifically Wellbutrin. Some personal context, I was diagnosed in October of 2015, I had been on a variety of medication up until March of 2016 at which point I settled on Wellbutrin. I have been on 300 mg of Wellbutrin ever since.

I just finished my first semester at college, and over the course of the semester I have had some ups and downs. However, overall the experience has been a net positive. I made some great friends, enjoyed two of my classes, and didn't completely fail my classes.

In the last two months I noticed that my medication was having very little effect. Depression-wise, I have hit a plateau. I wasn't getting better, but I was also not hitting too many lows.

I started occasionally skipping days on taking my medication. Not completely intentionally, I would just put it off to later due to other priorities (studying for finals) and just end up forgetting to take it. I met with a new psychiatrist (from the college) with whom I discussed the feelings of hitting a plateau, and got a prescription bump to 450 mg (I didn't mention that I occasionally skipped days).

In the past couple of days, almost a week at this point, I haven't taken any Wellbutrin at all. I feel just fine.

Since I have had depression for almost year now, I forget what feeling normal is like. I can't tell if I am back to ""normal"" or if my current feelings are the ""new normal"".

I know I should (and probably will) talk to the psychiatrist about this, but I just wanted to hear some anecdotal accounts of anyone who has tried to go cold turkey with Wellbutrin. I would love to get off medication if I could, but I understand that such a rapid transition can be detrimental.",3," wondering if anyone here ever decided to abruptly end taking their medication,was diagnosed in October of 2015,noticed that my medication was having very little effect.

"I have had suicidal thoughts almost every day since I was around nine years old. I have been on a few different types of anti depressants:
Zoloft
Effexor 
Celexa
Trazodone (mostly for sleep but paired with Effexor)

I don't understand why I have these thoughts. I have acted on them in the past and obviously I survived. Sometimes I have them when my mood is really bad and things are really hard. Thoughts are like: it would be easier if I just ended this. I'm tired of living.

Other thoughts happen when I am generally rather happy or even excited. The thoughts are more like: yes this is nice, but life honestly feels so monotonous or pointless. It'd be better if I died. I don't have a purpose here. I get in the way. These people don't actually care about me. I'm too much trouble and I am a burden. They would be a lot happier not having to deal with me. I should just kill myself. It would have been better if I had died last time I tried.

And other times it's very random. Such as when I'm driving. They bother me a lot and I was recently told it wasn't normal to have thoughts like this. I used to think everyone would think things like this from time to time, but I was told that they don't and it disturbed me.

My moods are difficult to handle at times. I feel like I'm all over the place. Sometimes I'm doing very well and feel pretty confident about things. I set goals. But when it crashes, I feel miserable and I quit eating, bathing, and generally just taking care of things. It's like looking through someone else's eyes. Like what I'm doing doesn't matter and I don't know why I'm bothering to do it. 

I haven't ever told anyone the real extent of my suicidal thoughts. No one knows I have them almost daily. When I told an individual I had them, she believed it was only in that moment and a couple of times. 

I wanted some advice. The thoughts scare me. Right now I wouldn't act on them. But I have tried a couple of times- as a teenager and once at 21 that I still don't know how I lived from and thankful I did. I was not hospitalized. Did it alone and stayed alone for about a week afterwards.

Hello. The situation is as follows:

I suffer from extreme depression. I have been diagnosed with some OCD symptoms, but other than that, I exhibit no ""abnormal"" traits, and consequently most of my friends do not know that often, I am in a lot of pain.

I went to this school to get away from home, and this decision was supported by my doctors. First year, I ran through some obstacles, but overall, my grades were alright. I made new friends, the dean of engineering supported me (he ended up knowing of my depression), and although both semesters were hard, I would say that I did a good job.

Sophomore year, I also dealt with pain, but I had developed more ways to get rid of it. I had joined the dodgeball club, several intramural teams, and worked on a math conjecture which I later proved, which I was told needed graduate level work. 

I went through a variety of small situations in college, which I will not go into detail. It is universally agreed and seen that I have not made an attempt to hurt anyone or myself, nor have I made a threat to anyone or my own life. No fights, no animosity between me and teachers, nothing. I have spoken of being in a lot of pain, and one response to me disclosing this to professionals, which I now know is controversial, was to encourage me to go to a ward. I kept repeating that I thought it was a bad idea, but I finally gave in, and the result was terrible. I missed my classes, I was in a place where I was not allowed any homework or devices, and I felt separated from my friends. And I came to realize that the school may be playing a game to get me to leave. 

 Although I made many friends that see a happier, kind of smart guy who seems great to hang out with, I sought help with very close friends who were really extraordinary people who support me as I type this. I talked about my depression with these people, and they supported me, and we shared a common goal of me recovering to a much happier, less anxious person. 

One of these friends confided in someone from the staff that she was worried about me. She meant no harm by it, and was possibly optimistic that the person might help. The response, which she forwards back to me was to cut off all communication with me. This is from someone (the faculty member) who knows one thing about me- that I am depressed.

Time goes on, and I make it through freshman year. It was tough, but I know that staying close or at home would slowly break me. 

Fast forwarding through sophomore year, to the end of the first semester. I got sick, which prevents from exercising. I depend on exercise to relieve stress and I am in fantastic shape as a result. Strike 1. Then, because I was sick, I was in too much pain to sleep. So I didn't sleep for a whole night. Strike 2. Then I got drunk. Strike 3.

As I was drunk, I expressed suicidal thoughts. I was crying out for help, saying that I was in a lot of pain. Fast forward after that, since the next information will make the stuff in between not very helpful, and we have the student conduct board determining it was okay for me to go back. They were super kind, and the last call I had with them was very comforting with them. I met with my psychiatrist and told him everything, and he agreed I was ready to go back to school. Things weren't great, but they were easier. I was abused by security guards in the hospital they took me to(whole nuther story) and I was still trying to recover. Friends who were worried about me expressed their hope for my well-being. A teachers were happy when I told them I was allowed to go back, with all of them being very supportive.

It is important to keep in mind that, because of fear of something unfair happening, I keep my depression almost entirely to myself. 

Fast forward to now, I receive a call from the dean of student health and well-being that he wants me to leave. As simple as that. I tell him everything- that my parents think this is a bad idea, that professional opinion thinks its a fucking horrible idea, and that I have been studying hard to make up for the stuff I missed. He doesnt give a shit and insists on the meeting which has the chance to break me. 

Part of me sees this as a formality. He never explicitly stated that I will have to leave, and merely encouraged it at first. He says he will contact a third party evaluator to check on me, and this kind of comforts me cause if this person isn't from the school, I can easily convince him/her that a) I am not going to be in that situation again because I will never drink again b)that leaving the school with my closest friends and losing my courses there will leave me in a terrible state.

I ended up doing research and I learn that these meetings end up being one-sided. I did more research, and I see, given the situation, it violates the Americans with Disabilities Act on so many  levels.

Again, I do not know what they could or will do, and I politely expressed my concern with the dean who called me that I am worried that this meeting is a scam trying to flush me out. Of course I did not use those words. What worries me is that this person will eagerly ignore medical professionals or my reasoning that this was a bad idea to go on with the meeting. He has an extremely small, if any, amount of evidence that shows me as someone who should leave. But I am worried of how corrupt this meeting is.

Can someone please help me? I've been feeling sick after hearing about this. I have gotten a lot of support from friends, which, in written form, plays a role in the meeting. At least 10 people in 2 days have desired to write letters of support. I want to know if the absurdity of this leaves me another option other than crying. I know this is unfair, but the difference about this and, say, a bad referee call, is that this decision threatens my well-being and crushes the little chance I have to recover.",3,"Depression, OCD,engineering, Sophomore year dealt with pain, drunk, suicidal thoughts, hospiatized, abused by security guards,   dean, asked to leave"
"Call it FOMO, jealousy, whatever you wish. I have spent 22/24 hours of each day for the past 12 months at home, in a 10x12 room staring at a fucking computer screen, because I have lost the energy to do anything else. This past year has been absolutely the hardest (outside of when I was hospitalized against my will about 15 years ago, which ended up doing zero good for me, surprise surprise.). I have been to about 12 or so medical professionals, had 3 CTs, 2 xrays, been on 20 different medications, and they can't figure out why I'm sick. They say I don't have cancer, which while horrible would have at least been an answer. It is entirely fucked up, I fully recognize that, but there are days that if a doctor told me I have only a month or so left to live, I'd cry in relief. I've seen specialists who treat me as just another number who got unlucky in life. Unlucky in life, boy, that sure does sum it up though. Abusive family, criminal father, automatic black sheep from birth, poor, redheaded, fat from young age, bullied, sick a LOT, etc etc. Blah fucking blah. At least I'm not hungry, though, right? That's supposed to make you feel better, comparing your misfortune to others'. The problem with that is your experiences are exactly that. You can't help but view your continuing chain of fucking shit problems as well, exactly that, to be rather repetitive. I don't know, I guess I'm ranting. I feel like I'm taking up space. I even thought about what my room would be used as once I'm not around anymore, whatever that ends up meaning. Maybe Mom could convert it into an office. That'd be nice. I do live at home, but at least that's for a good reason I suppose. Those 2 hours I mentioned? That's transporting my elderly grandfather back and forth from his day care program.

I guess he'd go to a nursing home. So I suppose I'm a better choice than those nightmarescapes of fucking places. I don't know.

well she went to work today, 4-8, and told me before hand her friend asked her to drink with her tonigjt for new years and she told me she said no and promised she would spend the time with me

out of the blue she said she might need to stay at work longer for new years, then switched the reason to her friend needed help at the front desk (the friend who asked her to drink), and she stayed there for another 6 hours, hardly messaged me, then sent a confusing message 3 hours ago and she stopped getting my messages since, she would be home by now from work and if her phone died shed charge it, but that makes 8 extra hours of work which is severely unlikely. i really think she drank and that is killing me on the inside

when the clock struck 12 i was alreadt crying and 10 minutes into the new year i cut myself, and now im in full blown panic mode because shes still not responding

she alwaus says she never lies to me, but if she drank tonihjt she broke her promise not to because she said she didnt like it, she crushed my hopes of being with her and i spent new years alone crying, and she completely destroyed my start to the year.

i might be thinking irrationally because ive been panicking but can someone please give me their advice on what to do?? im shakinf and not gonna be able to sleep

sorry for the wall of text im just in a horrible place and feel like im in danger of self harm yet again",3,"girlfriend has stomach ulcer, open to other guys, alcohol,  stayed longer at work, hardly messaged me"
"I really kinda just want to vent a little I guess? I have terrible general and social anxiety that feeds into my depression, and I live a fucking nightmare. I know (because others have told me, however won't say what was said) that people talk about me behind my back. I don't know what they say ever, and I also don't know who does. This is brutal as far as my anxiety goes, and I have a tendency to catastrophize over small things, and it spirals until I'm a dysfunctional mess. More recently, I've been paranoid that none of my friends actually care about me, since they seem to be avoiding me irl more recently. I have friends that are depressed and understand how I feel when it comes to my depression, but they give off the same vibe and I'm at a loss. Beyond that, I'm currently in a really fucked up domestic situation. I haven't seen my dad in coming up on a year now, mainly because he was somewhat emotionally abusive for a while, and I couldn't take it anymore, and my mom and stepdad are always almost 5 hours from me with the exception of holidays. I'm 17, finishing high school while living with my grandparents. I stayed here for 2 reasons: Transferring schools for senior year would suck, and I value my relationships here a lot, but like I said before my relationships seem to be falling apart. Being with my grandparents stresses me out, and it's hard on them too, so I just feel like a burden to them. I talk to 2 different therapists, and I am on 3 different medications for my depression and none of them help. The only time I ever have felt happy recently was the one time I got high smoking weed with a couple friends a few weeks ago. I was in a relationship from May of two years ago until November of this year, and she broke up with me for what I feel like was a bogus reason. I was in a skype call with some people and after a while of not talking I just left because I couldn't handle it anymore and felt like I was just there to feel like people cared about me for once. I didn't feel like they actually did anymore and I've spent the rest of the night feeling like shit. I feel like such a nuisance, and that my existence is a bother to everyone, including myself. I wish there was a way to disappear, and not have anyone remember I ever was there.

I had a car crash today. Started in far left lane ended up in far right ditch. Snow flew over car while my friend and I slid about 15 meters in 2-3 feet deep of snow.


While this was happening, while my car was sliding towards the edge of the road I didn't feel any fear or anything.. I saw the oncoming ditch and just accepted the fact that there was nothing I could do. No fear.  I just reacted like a robot


Is this normal? People around me parents etc keep telling me I have depression because I don't show emotions at all to them. I'm starting to wonder myself.. to me it would seem normal to feel fear as I drove into a ditch at 100 kph.. but I didn't

I've had major depressive episodes since I was 15, with these culminating in a hospital stay at 17. Since then I have tried to live with my depressive tendencies and fight, just putting one foot in front of the other and using medicine to help even me out. This year, I've hit a wall I believe.

Starting in January, I noticed my marriage of 8 years was failing, but I stuffed it back in my mind because I didn't want to admit it. This continued until the end of May when I found out about infidelity and apathy on her part. Afterward, I lost most of my support network, with only my mother and father, one life-long friend, and one 1/2 life long friend remaining to help (I lost my extended family 6 or 7 years ago because of lawsuits arising from a death in the family). There is a lot of hurt on both sides, but at this point in time, I don't feel anger will fix anything. I would rather try to get thru this and let her find what she is looking for somewhere else.

I focused on my health to try to forget the pain and found out from my doctors that I will be lucky to live till 60 because of a complex back problem (kyphosis/stenosis/degenerative disc/degenerative bones/arthritis). I was already on pain meds for these conditions, and hoped for some type of surgery to lessen the pain; I was told I am too messed up to fix. I was also hoping to get off of Lyrica, which caused my weight to balloon to over 300 (I used to be 200-220),

I then focused on a skin condition I have and after a month long process, found out I have Hidradenitis Suppurativa, a condition that is rather depressing all by itself. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidradenitis_suppurativa). Because of its location (my neck), I have to treat it or it can turn into cancer, instantly spreading to my CNS and brain. I have had to start Humira, a drug that weakens your immune response in order to fight the H.S.

After going thru all of this, today I found out my wife canceled my insurance without telling me, possibly hurting my meds and causing problems with my treatments. I had to call her and tell her 1/2 of my medical situation; I don't want to burden her with things that may make her life harder, and have become rather private about my life normally (I feel here I can just talk without being judged, so I am talking about it all now). It was productive and she is going to try to add me back on (we are still married), but I am in store for a fight with the insurance company so I can continue my treatments. She also told me of some problems she has now, and even though I know that she helped create those problems for herself, I feel sad that she is having to go thru them.

I am starting to wonder why I even bother having a positive outlook anymore. I'm truly afraid I am going to die alone (as in single) and possibly before my parents (they are 70 this year). I feel like I have wasted my life, accomplishing nothing and bringing pain to all around me. I'm hoping for a better 2017, but I am not holding my breath.

Thank you for reading, I just needed to get this all out.",3,"Depression ,complex back problems, pain meds, surgery,skin condition, might turn into cancer, insurance policy cancelled by wife"
"Started this new med after failures with Lexapro and Cymbalta. After my primary talked about starting me on this new Med I got concerned and turned to the community for testimonies and different peoples experiences. After cycling off Cymbalta which was hell by the way I've been on trintellix 5mg for 3 days now the side effects are unreal. Nauseous 5 minutes after taking medication until I go to bed 14 hours later mood swings are off the charts I've been more depressed than I have been in the past 6 months and to add to it I am now light-headed and dizzy constantly. And don't get me wrong I understand when starting a new Med I am prone to nausea and mood swings and instability or whatever else you want to call it but I have never been nauseous for 2 days as a side effect and I've never had mood swings comparable to this. My head is always killing me which again common side effect of antidepressants ssris you name it but this is weird. It seems like a disconnect between my brain my head and my body.. I don't know how to explain it other than foggy Maybe.. I've also noticed when I get a spike in Adrenaline,  and then settle back down it seems to hit me all at once.  and coming down from adrenaline on this is not a gentle slope into calmville, its an abrupt atom bomb of whatever chemical it may be and it bottoms me out so far that I've nearly collapsed while working twice. I mostly just wondering if this is a potential side-effect that may go away after chemical levels balanced out or build up, but this is unnatural and I'm not going to be able to stay on this medication any longer if this continues.

"I'm a 20 year old guy. I won't rant how bad 2016 was or anything since I go through a bad phase every now and then. Ending the year I entered another one. And I know new year new me is BS but I'm really trying to get my shit together this year and be productive but some things always pull me down. Right now I've cut off every so called friend of mine who was close to me when I started '16 because I kind of hated how less people valued me and how much they used me. But for a start, I feel really good about cutting them off and moving forward even though that means I'm alone, I'm trying to use this time to start appreciating my life more and maybe meet new, less toxic, people. But with all the me time, I tend to think a lot. And most of the thoughts are negative. First off, I kind off hate my body and I can get really conscious about it around people and depressed when I think of it.  Starting from bottom, I am a bit knock kneed that makes my walk different, people keep telling me why I walk like that and the more they say the more conscious I get when I walk towards someone or a group. Having knock knees, I'm really uncomfortable when I wear any kinds of shorts or skinny pants since it's really visible then. After that, I have minor gynecomastia (puffy nipples) which makes my chest look less manly and fat. I can't even take off my shirt without getting uncomfortable af. Then I have a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. I get lumps under my armpits and groin area . These can be painful and give a bad odour. The lumps can also drain pus and blood which can easily show up on my tshirts or undergarments. I have an overbite which makes my chin looks weak and the whole face unsymmetrical. I also have weird shaped fingers which actually don't hinder anything but people just notice and often make fun of 'em. Hell I cant even go bald if I want to because my head is not even round because how I slept as a baby. 
I have asthma as well and it just wont go away. I've to take my inhaler almost daily. 
Yes I've been hitting gym and people have been complimenting the muscles I have put on but all the problems that I have, they're not fixable (some of them can be fixed by surgery but they're costly) and it kinda depresses me thinking why out of all people, I have all of these things. I've never been happy of my body and I dont know how to cope with it and since I dont have many people to talk to I cant help but think about it over and over again facing the mirror or the other time I'm thinking why people do me dirty and why I can't have strong social bonds. Also the fact that I have achieved nothing in my life so far and have been mediocre at everything I have done doesn't help as well.
All this usually puts me in a bad mood and outweighs all the positive thoughts that I try to bring.

"There are many things that bother me about myself, and those only seemed to have intensified and even multiplied over the past year. I would say all-in-all I will remember 2016 as the years my expectations dropped so low that it has surpassed the depths of cynicism to the point that I feel no different than a (barely) sentient robot. 
2016 is also the year I managed to grow disgusted with the world by the realization that everything in the modern world just seems no different than a movie set, with the plastic wrapping still on and showing. I came to these overwhelming realizations while I've been stoned, and by this virtue I don't know if I can consider these realizations out right depressive symptoms or just moments of supposed clarity in the state of inebreation. All I know is that these moments stick with me through my daily life and have tangibly affected how I feel and act. Maybe I really have been depressed and these high realizations just provided rationalization for why I feel this way, or maybe this is caused directly by the weed. This makes it difficult to know if it is appropriate to make posts on here, as 2016 incidentally was also the year I began smoking pot habitually from the years onset, a habit that I had only picked up towards the end of the previous year and which also strangely correlated with the onset with this feeling of disgust. 
The year 2016 has pushed me into an uncomfortably cushy state of apathy wherein all my ambitions, desires and pleasures have fizzled away. Out of the many undesired changes I've experienced over the year, my apathy has kept me from remembering every detail that I've conceived, but one that really stuck out to me happened last night during an attempt to reconnect with a friend who was visiting my city. He travelled there with his girlfriend with whom he was spending most of his time, and so I barely to catch up with him as a buddy. Whenever he made a comment towards me, I would bypass responding sincerely and just try to go for a smug witty response. This habit has gotten worse over the year, and they're not even as impressive as they once were so it doesn't make people laugh as much to distract them from my impersonability (one of the symptoms I forgot to mention). And since I was resorting to this everytime I was addressed my friend and anyone else I had met there started realizing and ended up talking to me less. I had realized that when doing this it was mostly unintentional and it impeded on my ability to actually connect with these people. It was another red pill realization that I've unintentionally been avoiding personal connection for the past year, and instead I've just been abusing my tendency to replace a two way conversation with a smart-ass remark. Whenever I didn't poorly execute this i had absolutely nothing to say, and so I ended up staying to myself and observing everyone else have fun and enjoy each other's company, while I observed as if through a TV. At some point I started to question whether I was on the autism spectrum, something I hadn't considered before that. 
To end this thought I just want to mention that I hope 2016 has been at worst an anomaly for what should otherwise be a good life for me, and what I mentioned here, though it may just be grazing on the surface of a myriad of issues I had, should be possible to backtrack from and return to my last point when I felt content. But this year I have repeated fond memories from earlier in my life and they felt bleaker and less visceral. I'm hoping that in 2017 I can gain my emotions, humor, joys, ambitions, and personality back because this apathy is torturous. 
I hope what I wrote here is coherent and fits well enough into this sub. Cheers and enjoy your year all

"Hi all,

A friend of mine has gone down a depression spiral over the past year and 1/2. She has seen psychologists and psychiatrists and the only thing they seem to help with is medication. 

She has refused to take the medication properly. She started but stopped after feeling terrible. 

She will make plans and then cancel them because of her panic attacks. They happen daily at specific times, she has one at 7am daily. They will also occur intermittently throughout the day and which point she will be unable to do anything but runaway and be alone, presumably. 

She cannot work, remember things consistently, or think.

She has attempted to jump out of a moving vehicle.

Friends and family have all come to her aid but she essentially refuses any kind of answer because they do not solve her issues. I'm not sure there is a correct answer. 

The biggest source of sadness for her is her age, coupled with where she is in life. She has spent the past 4 years in a masters program for biology that most likely will not amount to a job. She feels as if she wasted her time and will have nothing to show for it. 

I have suggested changing fields but she doesn't have the financial resources to do so comfortably. She is also engaged and doesnt not feel comfortable relying on her fiance for money.

She doesn't make a lot of money, so paying for therapy isn't an option, really.

"A Sinus Infection Ruined my Life. 

Dude. It‚Äôs Fucked. 

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be like the way I am.

I changed a few details to protect anonymity. If you need to match me with a name, feel free to know me as Mitchell. 

I had it all: the grades, the friends, the talent‚Ä¶ I had it all. 

I was the best at everything I did. I was that guy you hated. I was him. 

Then I had a sinus infection. My life was fucked over by a sinus infection. I wish I was joking. 

Well, I didn‚Äôt exactly know I had a sinus infection. The doctors didn‚Äôt know either:

I vomited multiple times a day; I suffered from extensive head aches; I felt broken because no one knew what was wrong. 

I saw gastroenterologists because of the vomiting. They couldn‚Äôt figure it out.

I saw allergists because they thought I had allergies. They were wrong.

I saw countless other doctors. 

I then saw a neurologist (God bless). I had an MRI and a CT.

Just that alone was enough to ruin me (I knew that they were looking for tumors). 

Because of the scans, we found a sphenoid sinus infection. I know this is a strong thing to say, but I wish it was a tumor; it would have been easier. 

They gave me super strong antibiotics (without probiotics‚Ä¶ :c). Basically, in short, the antibiotics fucked over my digestive system and created very fun trips to the potty. It lasted for a while. One complication over another. My body was compromised and malnourished. I was getting close to looking like a skeleton (I just read over everything I have written so far, and realized I missed a ton of things. Let‚Äôs just say it ended up a lot worse than how I described it).

This all happened over a period of 323 days (I started counting at day 3). 

I attempted to step back into school and failed miserably. I now had social anxiety because of a few obvious reasons. 

I lost my hobbies, my friends, my girlfriend, and myself.

Overtime, the anxiety led to me learning and ‚Äòdoing school‚Äô from home. 

Being socially isolated led to depression. 

Seriously, the tumor would have been better.

Let‚Äôs skip through the nasties of depression (this is a subreddit about depression, I‚Äôm sure we don‚Äôt need a review). 

I came out the other side of the long and dark tunnel into another long and dark tunnel. I had treatment resistant depression (I‚Äôve seen multiple psychotherapists and tried almost every type of cocktail they could throw at me). 

I continued finishing up my high school career with a clouded mind. I was depressed all the time (anxiety gone, thank god). I couldn‚Äôt focus on anything. I had no energy to do anything.

Let‚Äôs hop to the last two months.

I asked for adderall to just help me focus on my school work so I could just keep moving on (until I figured out how I wanted to end things with myself).

Adderall‚Ä¶ ADHD‚Ä¶? Nope! Adderall = Treatment resistant depression!

No joke. The adderall gave me energy. It gave me life. It helped my focus on what is ahead of me. It gave me the urge to go be me. I started to become -excited- about going out of my house and doing homework. 

This is where I am now. 

I‚Äôm doing homework. I‚Äôm talking to people. I‚Äôm being what I think I am supposed to be. Well‚Ä¶ when I can‚Ä¶ :c

Adderall is my antidepressant. It‚Äôs the only thing that works. Even with XR Adderall‚Ä¶ it only lasts for about 5 hours. I am only allowed to take two a day (insurance blows now). 

So, I only get about 9 hours a day to be‚Ä¶ well me. Happy, energetic, and beautiful. Then I start to fall down the abyss that we all know. Some nights I fall deep. Some nights it's only a few feet. 

I‚Äôm not really happy me because happy me isn‚Äôt sad half of the day. 

I‚Äôm cheating depression. It‚Äôs always there and I don‚Äôt give it the respect that it deserves. It doesn‚Äôt respect me.

I have a feeling this will be the rest of my life. 

I'm lost now.

"Ive been on Viibryd for about a year give or take. The first few months I gained about 20lbs and all together ive gained 25lbs( last I knew.) I stopped weighing myself about 2 months ago because it was getting even more depressing. I've read a few forums and have noticed that most people have experienced rapid weight gain with this medication, and no matter how hard they've worked- the weight wont budge. same issue here. I'm ready to ditch this medication because 1. I'm sick of dealing with the weight gain, going to the gym 3-6 times a week has done nothing. 2. it seems to increase my anxiety at times. 3.Its expensive(even with a coupon code and insurance.) The thing is- I'm VERY scared as I know that depression can become harder to treat over time. I tried probably about 8 medications before I found this one- I really thought there was no hope beforehand. I've stuck it out because obviously mental health is more important that weight gain, but the weight gain is causing me to obsess over what I eat/how often I workout. 

Does anyone currently take viibryd? Have you even come off of it, what was it like? I heard the withdrawals are horrible. ",3,"been on Viibryd , rapid weight gain, withdrawals are horrible"
"So like many of us,  I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. 

About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation ,   and it was incredible.  It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person.

Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it,  thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds.   Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. 

Went back to the doctor.   We tried celexa again-   didn't work.   wasn't anything like the first time.   then put me on wellbutrin-  didn't really work either.    then we finally tried effexor-  same deal,  didn't notice any positive changes. 
I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also.  

i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do.   i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years.   I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa.  but i've not been able to find it.

"It‚Äôs been almost a month now of consistent terrible break outs, and I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take on myself. I look in the mirror and feel absolutely disgusted with what I see. I dread waking up in the mornings as I can feel a new pimple or bump on my face that wasn‚Äôt there when I went to sleep. I have lost myself to acne completely, and it‚Äôs ruining my life. I take a shower, and don‚Äôt want the mirror to show how inflamed and disgusting my face is. I just want a normal face color. I‚Äôm tired of browsing routines, regimes, diets, medications, products, birth controls because it all feels helpless. I just feel as though I am a lost cause. Acne isn‚Äôt the problem making me depressed, it‚Äôs my reaction to it. I can hardly remember a time when I felt confident without a full face of foundation. I feel as though I‚Äôm fighting a losing battle everyday as I will take it and tell myself it doesn‚Äôt matter, but the majority of the day it‚Äôs all I think about. I‚Äôve become obsessed with it, because I want it to be gone. It makes me feel ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù and unattractive. I think when people see it, they think there is something wrong ‚Äì making me ugly.

 As much as I love my boyfriend, and I know how much he loves me, I can‚Äôt help but letting this skin disease and my mind tell me I‚Äôm not worthy of him because of it. He should be with a girl who has a flawless face, who doesn‚Äôt go to sleep with spot treatments on her face, and wakes up crying about a new cyst that formed overnight. He deserves to wake up to someone who can roll over and smile confidently at him knowing that she isn‚Äôt covered in disgusting cysts and pimples. He should have a girlfriend that doesn‚Äôt have breakdowns about how I feel, and how disgusting I look; essentially having to talk me down all the time. It‚Äôs a burden and it‚Äôs annoying, he should not have to deal with it. I don't want to tell him or anyone how I feel, because no one should have to deal with a depressed person; he should have a fun, outgoing person. (The person I was before acne took over my life) It makes me feel unworthy of having children, They would deserve a mother who doesn‚Äôt hate the way she looks and feels depressed because of it. How could I possibly have children when I feel and look like this? I feel like my nephew deserves an aunt who doesn‚Äôt let these things affect her, a better aunt than I am. I even feel as though I don‚Äôt deserve my dog, she is so good and pure and I‚Äôm so depressed and self-hating. My dog makes me so happy, but I even feel unworthy of her love.  I am starting to hate myself, which I really had never done before. 

I know people say it doesn‚Äôt define you, but I‚Äôm letting it define me. I know people they don‚Äôt care about it, but they have to. It‚Äôs become severe, and I can‚Äôt do anything currently to stop it. I‚Äôve sunken into a deeper depression every day, I‚Äôm having a hard time enjoying myself with anything anymore because of how profoundly unhappy this makes me. I know it‚Äôs something internal, but what more could I do. I feel as though I‚Äôve tried everything except Accutane, which is going to happen at the end of this month due to the waiting period. I was told all hormonal birth control essentially balances your hormones, so I don‚Äôt know if the birth control I‚Äôve been on for 5 years is hurting or helping; but I‚Äôve had acne before starting it. I tried Spiro, which caused more and more breakouts for 8 weeks.. I‚Äôve been on antibiotics for 6 years or so, and they have finally stopped working. I‚Äôm happy to start Accutane, maybe it will give me a new lease on life. Or maybe I will be back where I started. I can‚Äôt take this anymore, every day I feel closer and closer to the ledge.. I know this sounds dramatic, but I cry about this all day and night and think about it 24/7. It‚Äôs driving me insane. I‚Äôve tried to distract myself, but I‚Äôve had a hard time doing that lately. 

I wasn't sure what sub to post this on. I guess I just needed to say something to anyone.

"And how utterly afraid I am. I suck at college. I am absolutely terrible at it. I just cannot seem to pull my head out of my ass when it counts. I am so unmotivated, not to mention tired. So damn tired. All the time. 

A lot of my worth is based on grades. When I was in school I would push myself too hard. After my anorexia calmed down a bit, so did my motivation to do schoolwork. Or anything. Without my eating disorder.

Ever since my eating disorder has been ""cured"" (and by that I mean calmed down to point where it's manageable enough that I don't have the constant need for exercise or racing thoughts over food and such) it's also had another impact: My motivation. I've noticed this ever since my anorexia really left me, my motivation is shot. I can't do college not because I don't have the mind or the resources but because I am simply not motivated enough to do anything. Before this, my anorexia and school work were tied together tightly and when I was in my funk but not so malnourished to function, my productivity would soar because it made me perfectionistic. Now, with that gone, I just can't find that motivation anymore.

But it doesn't just stop at school work. I am so tired lately. So incredibly tired. When I had my eating disorder I felt like I could lift mountains (until the wall hit of course) but now it's all I can do not to be asleep all of the time. It's why I don't go out much. Just getting out of my bed is harder than you can imagine. All I seem to ever want to do is sleep. I wake up and for and hour I'm all good, but after that it's a nap. And then 2 hours of wake and then I sleep the rest of the night. Luckily I don't have nightmares as I nap, only when I go for the long haul.

With the death of my anorexia (and to my shame I admit to trying to revive it several times) I have also lost my motivation and my spark it seems. Maybe it was because the only thing holding the haunting thoughts of trauma was my anorexia, and without that they are just free to take root in my mind and they very much do. The world is a much darker place. At least my anroexia had some sort of spark to it, as dark that flame was. Now I don't even have that.

Everything is just dark now. I have no motivation. No will. The only thing I seem to be able to bring myself to do is nap to avoid my pain. I'm honestly not sure what to do. I killed a enemy only to find it was merely the tail of a larger and more poisonous snake. 

Imagine seeing everything in back and white. That's pretty much how I see the world now. No more colors, no more fun shades. Just black and white. I'm more depressed now than I've ever been and no one is the wiser. I am so good at hiding it that no one sees anymore.",3,"eating disorder, anaorexia, lack of motivation, just want to sleep"
"Man lets see some of my highlights: 

-Started the year of doing lines of yack and smoking weed with people I thought would be my life long friends and overall brothers after all we had done and shared together.

-Met a beautiful girl online who I fell in love with. She was a first for me. Had a great amazing relationship at first but eventually our differences became too great and my depression mixed with her whole nonesense and bs kinda led to our on and off thing and us ultimately breaking up in september for good. I was devastated and depressed as fuck for a long time. For some reason checked her ig a while back and saw she moved on fairly quick and she's happier which kind of kills me inside a bit but overall at this point I'm happy for her and hope she finds what she's looking for.

-Almost didn't graduate cause I was too caught up in slacking off doing drugs and bumming out with ""friends"". But after a shit ton of detention (a grand total of 149 hours lol) I managed to get my shit together. My teacher Mrs. Nelson cried because of my actions and ultimately made me take school more seriously at the end and may just be the reason I graduated, Thank you Mrs. Nelson and I'm sorry i let my issues prevent us from having a really good relationship.

-Got sued cause of a stupid accident by a scam artist, but my insurance company handled it so I guess it wasn't to bad just really stressful.

-Tried killing myself a few times. One time I emptied a tank of gas on myself and almost lit myself on fire but the cops came and I was taken away to a psych ward. Met some crazy motherfuckers there but learned alot about myself. Once I got out of that place I needed a job after quiting my last one so I started pushing. That lasted a short while before I got my act together.

-Started college and went for a month before dropping out. 

-Got arrested after my dad called the cops on me after I hit a wall with some plyers lol. He stretched the truth a shit ton Got charged with felonies and now I'm facing jail time. Been going to anger management and rehab and now I'm starting to face and handle issues better than I would in years past. 

-I was homeless for a while. This taught me the importance of money, homes, and life. Being out in 20 degree weather without much to your name can make you want to bust your ass off harder than you ever could have thought imaginable. 

-Tried to jump off a bridge a few weeks after my arrest. Got stopped by the cops. I was drunk and called my friends because Idk i wasn't good mentally. I was tired, sad, depressed and just overall unable to continue with life at the point I was in life. Lost alot if not all of my friends at the time. About 80 percent of them actually. We still say hello and talk from time to time but its not like it used to be. Can't say I blame them. 

Now moving into 2017 I just want to get back to living a life of normal day to day monotony with its perks here and there. I want to get a car and pursue my passion of automotive engineering and working on cars. I don't care about the bullshit as much and I'm just ready to move on.

I'd compare their problems to mine and think ""everyone is so weak Try living my life"" Now, my whole life I've been the most sensitive person I've ever met. I always felt proud of my unconditional, tireless compassion. But, my whole life I've always gotten my feelings hurt so easily and I spent wayyy to much time people pleasing and trying to get everyone to like me. As I said, lately I feel nothing for the less fortunate. If I notice say, someone being nasty at work to me, I observe it but give it zero other thoughts. I've been dating and I have no intentions for anything but sex. I have no close or bonding feelings with these men. So I actually like this feeling of self-reliance. To not be such a people pleaser has made my life a lot easier. What gets me nervous is my impulsiveness. I keep doing things to see if I'll get caught, or hurt or arrested. Like, I'm a waitress and a customer was slightly snappy with me. No big deal. I decided to spit in his drink so if he continued to be rude I could have a good laugh about it. 2 men I've slept with have girlfriends and to this day we still text/hookup and I could care less for the girl whose relationship I'm invading. I don't even try to rationalize this behavior. I just have no concern whatsoever about how others feel. I drive very fast, all the time. Recklessly and aggressively too. If I think I can definitely get away with it I'll steal and feel nothing, no guilt. If you read this and can't get past the ""sleeeping with taken men"" or are horrified I'd spit in food, I already know it's despicable, I just don't care. If you wanna reply with some useful insight or personal experience with this please go right ahead. If you wanna just bash my shitty actions go right ahead too.

"Hi.
So, um... I'll just write shit down how it is in my head. I've had a lot of bad things happen to me and when I've sought help to deal with mental issues I've been told that in cases such as mine most people have either committed suicide, on heavy drugs or are in prison. I'll admit I've had my moments and I've done some crazy shit since I've been around 5 or 6 and I'm now 30. I am now on a heavy dose of antidepressants which I have realised does not stop you feeling depressed but helps you deal and manage it. It has definitely helped with my anxiety though. I've kind of thought that because I'm such an odd character and quite misunderstood that I would start finding ways to help myself and I've done this by excessively focusing on certain things. I've focussed on fitness and weight lifting I also enjoy gaming and streaming which has also helped with my anxiety. Don't get me wrong, there are days I wish I could clean the whole fucking house and not lay in bed wanting to destroy myself... they're are days where my mind and focus is a bit off and sometimes even way off but I can say these days it's a lot better than it used to be. It used to be waking up not knowing whether or not I was going to die or other people around were going to feel safe. Having been getting better with my anxiety I have now made new friends, talking does not bother me and I'm more relaxed I've even flirted with a girl which was nice. I do have another issue I would love to fix, I have a stutter which I've pretty much had forever. But you know what, I don't even care at all. Fuck it.
My advice to people in that state where they just want to die is, well think about this you're going to die eventually so may as well wait until it happens naturally or I guess unexpectedly. I know what you're saying, the pain of living is too much. I know. I've been through in order of age and events: hallucinations and hearing things along with nightmares from age 2 until about 11 then I was sexually abused, beaten by a drunk father almost weekly and I was bullied pretty much every day of my life until I finished school. My mother was abusive, her boyfriend was abusive, I lost my sister to mental illness she's not dead just lost. My son died (dog) I lost my job then my girlfriend of 9 years then my house then my mind my souls and my humanity. Getting everything back to stable was hard. I tried killing myself many times, well I planned it many times and I don't know how I never actually did it. My girlfriend at the time was also pushing me and provoking me knowing I was trying to kill myself. I can go into a lot more detail but it's a long story and there are many other shitty things I've gone through but you know what. Here I am! I'm alive and I've been through that and more so I feel that I win!! I conquered all that and I still smile, I laugh and I enjoy things. We're all bigger and better than the things that have hurt us, talk about things so that you can show it that it doesn't own you, that it doesn't hurt you and that it has no power! All the things you're afraid to do, do it! Unless it's kill yourself don't do that because you, each and everyone of you deserves to live no matter what you've done and what mistakes you've made! This is life and no one gets out alive so live it up and love!

"Alright, here's the deal; I haven't slept in about twenty two hours and my mother is blaring the TV whilst my sisters are screaming, so I'll just say that this may end up being despicably sloppily written, and pathetically long. 

Okay, so now that that's out of the way, I'll get into what it is that brings me here.

In the summer of 2016 I met somebody who quite honestly, as cliched as it sounds, changed my life, and enlightened my soul with new experiences and knowledge and a love too deep, too overbearing for a lone human to take without an excruciating pain present in an almost constant cycle. 

Just saying, I'm a trans dude, in love with a dude, who also likes dudes (in fact, he was the one who helped me figure out my sexuality and supported me more than anyone else regarding my gender identity). Except he doesn't have romantic feelings towards me. Lovely, ain't it?

Anyway, ever since the very first phrases uttered to each other, there was a connection. Heck, I felt that connection when I first laid eyes upon him. No, I'm not talking about love at first sight, but I am certain there was an excitement, an understanding, you know? And I'm pretty sure he felt that connection too.

And that connection was ignited like a fire which fed off of the act of fooling, the act of making the sweet and the ripe believe it was eternal. Less poetically put, when he he started talking to me less and less, when his vibe held this sort of apathy, I was very much so disheartened and in complete disbelief. More accurately, I still am. 

And I blame myself. I blame myself because of my various mental illnesses, and my annoying, whiny and pathetic behaviour whilst he put so much, so so much into helping me out. He gave me advice, he stayed up all night to talk me out of suicide, he did everything in his power to convince me that I wasn't some useless loser. And he genuinely thought that. He genuinely cared. He genuinely thought I was an amazing human being. And frankly, if it weren't for him, there is a great chance that I'd be dead by now. Yes, okay, I've tried killing myself multiple times over the course of our friendship, however each and every time I failed, and holy hell was he glad I failed.

I mean, that's obviously not the only thing we spoke about. Of course not. We have everything in common. Jesus, we even have the same favourite colours. I am not religious or spiritual or whatever, but this? This guy, this friendship, it's simply too much of a miracle for it to be over now. Cause, you know, we've drifted apart (for the record, he knows I'm totally into him, but that isn't what changed things).

Honestly, I've never had friends‚Äîlike, seriously, I've never had real friends‚Äîbut this guy, and when somebody introduces you to something new like this? When somebody finally makes you feel like you matter? Yeah, that's pretty darn difficult to just let go of.

My problem is, we haven't really spoken about my ""issues"" in a while, and I'm seriously just one big mess. I tried to kill myself the other night, and though I don't think I plan on trying again any time soon, I am completely lost and I have no one. No one. Therapists and all that just don't work in my situation, and honestly, I just need him. As a friend. As someone who's there for me.

Except I don't want to annoy him. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to make him feel bad, and any harsh feelings he may have towards me? Yeah, I deserve that, and I accept all of it. But I just don't know what to do. Would I be a complete and utter idiot if I texted him?",3,"met somebody, changed my life,  trans dude, gender identity, drifted apart,  donít want to annoy"

TL/DR: Severe depression, feeling guilty towards my fianc√© for dragging him down with me. Don't know what to do :'(


I am having a really tough time. I have been depressed for many years. I have always been insecure about my body (am overweight), bullied at school, not many friends, but I have been OK for the most part with a caring family for support. But after a couple of years of infertility and after a miscarriage of twins four years ago I developed a more severe depression and anxiety. I have been on SSRIs since the diagnosis witch seem to lower the anxiety but had not done much for my depression.

Lately I have been dealing with intense stress at work coupled with a decision to start trying to get pregnant again. This seem to have put my feelings in overdrive. I have been experiencing extreme anxiety ""attacks"" with several hours of crying without being able to stop. 

I was recently asked to think about when I last felt happy. I know when it was, it was when I found out I was pregnant over four years ago. 
Since after the miscarriage I can't think of a single moment that I have felt truly happy. I can't even remember how that feels like. In know that no one can be happy all the time, that's not how life works. But even when stuff goes my way, like when I proposed to my boyfriend or when I got my doctoral degree, I've not been happy. Glad, yes, but not happy if that makes any sense. 

I feel empty, miserable, like a waste of space and resources. I feel like people are wasting time when they are with me. I feel guilty all the time for bringing people around me down with me, especially my fianc√©.   When he asks me how I feel, I most often lie and say I'm ok. And he knows that I'm lying since he knows me all to well. When i do tell him exactly how I feel, he becomes sad and helpless. He says that he wants me to be honest, but when I am he can't handle it. He tries to fix stuff, like giving me phone numbers to helplines, websites with information, etc, when all I need is a shoulder to cry on and someone to agree worth me that life sucks. And yes, I have told him that that is what I need, and he tries. But he feels so uncomfortable when I cry and just sits there miserable while I feel guilty. 

I really really love him and we have been together for almost 10 years, but I feel that I'm wasting his time by being with him. He says that he loves me and I believe him, but love isn't everything. What comfort is love when every day I make him feel miserable just because I can't feel happiness? I also have zero sex drive. He wants to have sex every day, but itv happens only about once a month. Kissing and touching makes me feel really uneasy, but I pretend to enjoy it. Mostly it's OK, but sometimes I feel violated afterwards. I haven't told him this, I can't do that to him. We have discussed going to couples/sex therapy but I really don't want to tell him the truth since I know how much he will be hurt by it. 

I really don't know what to do. My insurance doesn't cover a psychologist/psychiatrist only a counselor. I have been to therapy with that counselor several times before and she made me feel even worse and that my misery was my own fault since I was so negative. She was one of those just-people (""just"" get over it / if you ""just"" think positive things will change / ""just"" stop feeling depressed).

I don't really know what I want to achieve with this post. Just needed to vent a bit. I hope that my doctor has something that can help me tomorrow.

If anyone had read this far, thanks for ""listening"".

"I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell. But long story short when things get really bad for me I sometimes get really clumsy and mess up a lot. For example, today I was skiing. Now I'm a fairly competent skier and I've been skiing most of my life. I was doing fine the last couple days but today I woke up feeling really bad. I eventually pulled myself out of bed and onto the hill, but when I got there it was like I couldn't even ski anymore. I fell a lot and my legs were all wobbly. Yesterday I was doing moguls and was going as fast as I could no problem. Today I fell down on nearly flat terrain. Bent my ski pole.

"So this happened a while ago and is pretty much in the past, but I went through some sort of drug induced psychosis or something. I don't know what happened but I went from half a year or so of doing nothing with my life and having no prospects, to utter ecstasy, in 45 minutes one night, the amount of time it takes for MDMA to kick in. I felt like I was the second coming of Jesus Christ, for a week, a month after, I don't know. Some sort of headspace where I thought I was the one with the ideas to save humanity. Depression to ectsasy in under an hour. I remember I had this thought ""repression of expression turns depression into aggression"", I'll get to why.

But shortly thereafter (in the days following the ""comedown"" of the MDMA but I didn't really come down, more like drug induced psychosis) I was having panic attacks and couldn't function and thought I was going to die sometimes for whatever reason. Just paranoia or whatever... very real paranoia, but just that, nothing more. It's sort of a blur looking back on it I don't remember the exact sequence of events. But eventually after ending up in the mental hospital emergency so many times they just said ""this time, you can't leave. You have 2 choices: voluntary or involuntary patient"". So I spent a night there... and that was it I didn't know how long I was going to be there. It gives a new perspective on life and how long it takes for you to start scoping out an escape route. Let's call it real life escape from Cidna mines in skyrim. It wasn't that bad though you know, comfortable beds, nice people, decent food. But there was an irony of me sitting across a table from a man scribbling ""BUZZ LIGHTYEAR"" in crayon all over a page and me scribbling circuit schematics for voltage dividers to try and explain to the nurses I was sane so they could let me out. I didn't need to plot an escape route though because I was released the next day. But for whatever reason, when I got home, this huge wave of depression hit me.... maybe it was just the rapid change of environment.... freedom, no freedom, freedom. What the hell am I supposed to do, that was the thought that came to my head... what does society want of me? To cure my diseased mind, or to put my unique mind to creative work? I didn't eat anything and just slept and then the next morning had some sort of panic attack or whatever and next thing I know I'm outside just screaming at nothing. I was hungry and thirsty and just wanted some fucking food and here are all these houses and I knocked on a door just to see if someone was there to help me but no. What a sick fucking society we live in, me with not enough water to get up over the hill (I was down in elevation maybe 100 feet, that's a big hill when you haven't eaten or drank anything and are depressed and don't have the energy to get up the hill). Yet here are dozens or maybe hundreds of houses all with water pipes in them and I can't have any. I was screaming ""GIVE ME SOME FUCKING WATER"" but of course no response. I finally just stood in the road and forced a guy in a truck to stop and I asked for his phone, and to prove to him I wasn't a thief I threw my shoe in his truck so that I'd be disadvantaged if I were to run away with his iphone. Just the fact that he gave me his waterbottle (the spontaneous social camaraderie) and the water got me up the first 50 feet or so back home. Then I just lied in the ditch because I didn't have the energy to get back up over the hill. A few cars drove by until a woman finally stopped, but (understandably looking back at it now) she drove by slowly with the doors locked and that she was of no real help (she offered some help but from a distance, not with the metaphorical open arms of the pickup truck guy) and considered me a criminal so I just yelled at her ""go the fuck to work"" or something really nasty and she drove off. But the fact that she had stopped at all gave me the energy... social comradery or whatever at least helped me find the energy to get back home.

Anyways the point of all that was that I couldn't function after that MDMA roll. I can function now, at least. But all my life I've had this anxiety of not being able to express myself in public speaking. Which is ironic because I've played music on stage in front of so many people. But I just have this fear of expressing myself, and when the fear finally burst and I spoke my mind, I lost my freedom, they put me in a mental hospital. So you can't blame me that I'm not too keen to really speak out in front of people that much... at all. I'm a smart guy, I have an engineering degree, I could design and build a computer from scratch given enough time and resources, but I just can't do the social thing. I mean in school or university they don't mind so much the creative or different ways of thinking but the mental hospital, society in general, considered me diseased. I don't relate to people that much. I haven't been on a date for almost a decade... and even back in highschool I never really connected with the girl I dated. I don't know if I did it to myself or if I'm a byproduct of the north american k-12 ""education"" system.

I just need to be able to relate to people. I can't do that and it's slowly killing me. I don't know what to do. I'm happy, but depression isn't happiness or sadness and although I've been given the same result, ""mildly/not depressed"", by different doctors, there is disorder there somewhere and I don't know how to turn it into just normal people order.",3,"drug induced, MDMA, panic attacks, real paranoia,  admitted to hospital, need to relate to people"

I wanted to see if anybody here had success with cutting back on alcohol consumption, and could potentially talk a little about how it helped them manage their depression. I drink too much. I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point.

I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion.

Hating my life has become a usual thing for me and thoughts of killing myself are very frequently occurring now. Just want to vent a little and see if anyone has any advice at all for me. 

Social anxiety/generalized anxiety has affected my life for as long as I can remember. Self-confidence has always been an issue and has been a barrier in making friends/maintaining the few friendships I do manage to make. I have had periods in my life where I have had a close group of friends to spend time with but I never seem to be able to make lasting friendships. Most of those friends have gone on to make other meaningful relationships in their lives and I was not able to continue being a part of it with them.  On top of this, my family is currently pressuring me to find a girlfriend and get married but since I have not had any relationship with a woman in the past, I have no idea what to do and this is now adding to my anxiety (they tried to introduce me to some girls but I blew all of the chances from lack of experience). I constantly worry about the fact that I am a virgin and no woman is ever going to want me because of it and I also have issues with self-image (hate looking in the mirror sometimes). The loneliness turned me on to porn a long time ago and now I think I have an addiction; I am ashamed of this and feel hopeless because I can never talk to anyone about it out of embarrassment.  
Even for the less embarrassing problems, the 2 members of my immediate family are dealing with a lot of stressful problems of their own and I don't want to continue burdening them with my issues. 

Also, I am currently enrolled in a university program that requires a lot of social interaction when the only thing I feel like doing most days is isolating myself and staying in bed. I feel like the weird guy in my class because I just don't have the energy to socialize and make small talk and even when I do, my anxiety makes it so that I babble on like a fool. It is getting to the point where I am making excuses to explain my absences and I am afraid I am going to fail out of the program or succumb to the immense pressure by doing something irreversible. 

Basically, I hate myself and I just wish I could escape from being me for a while. Getting out of bed is becoming more and more of a chore everyday and I feel sad, ashamed, hopeless, and tired.

"Hello everyone.

I've never actually reached out about my wellbeing before and don't really know how to, so I guess I'm just going to lay it all out on the table.

I'm 24 and I graduated college about three weeks ago, and I think there may be some thing or things wrong with me that I was ignoring as I gritted my teeth through my generally painful and unrewarding five-and-a-half year college experience. To keep things abbreviated, all I'll say here is that during that short time I had three major medical catastrophes (one of which will persist for the rest of my life), I was stalked for 7 months at one point, lived with an abusive couple, and had several family deaths. All of these negative stimuli gave me the opportunity to hand-wave my mental health difficulties as par for the course. It almost goes without saying, but my GPA was decimated by these experiences (my college has a terrible medical withdrawal system and as a result I have never taken any medical leave).

I would say I was ""doing well"" during my last two semesters (although my definition of doing well still involves a constant fog of anxiety and sleep issues); I was pursuing my interests relatively aggressively, making probably a B+ average in my classes, exercising 3x/week (this stopped a couple months ago), etc. During my final semester I was even working two part time jobs while taking classes. I still had these constant discomforts that I chalked up to school and proximity to recent hardship, but now after a few weeks of unemployment and no school I'm starting to think I'm incapable of enjoying myself in a healthy way (or at all really).

I have diagnosed ADHD and have always struggled in school, but in the last three years have really had to teach myself how to learn and devote myself to my studies. As a result I have learned a lot, but I also have lost a lot of my sense of identity. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 17, and have only been on one date in the intervening time. Additionally I have dropped essentially all of my hobbies, and my latent avoidant behaviors that have always subverted all of my efforts have become more and more disruptive. For instance, just tonight (it's 3:30AM where I live for context) I spent two and a half hours in my room while uncomfortably hungry in order to avoid interacting with my room mates (with whom I have no problems or stresses). After two hours of waiting, I compromised by grabbing a protein shaker and just walking to the kitchen while nobody was looking, rinsing it out, then making a protein shake with milk from my mini fridge in my room. It may seem like a silly example, but this kind of thing is reflected in every aspect of my life and I can't keep living this way.

For the last seven years (at least), I have also been bothered by a weird intrusive tick that I'm deeply ashamed of. I call it a tick, because it's not really a thought. It makes me cringe to even write it out, but for the longest time as I go about my daily forgettable tasks whenever I'm alone (or I'm at work and think I'm alone) I'll just mutter to myself some variation of ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""I'm going to get out of here"", or ""I'm going to wake up."" It's a lot like a hiccup; it comes out quickly and unexpectedly to the point where I can't even stop it until halfway through the sentence, and even then it's like cutting off a stream of piss (it basically requires me to hold my breath in the middle of a sentence). One of my deepest fears is that someone I know will hear me saying these things one day, although at this point it seems almost impossible that nobody has yet. I've only told two people in my life about these things, and I consider both of those conversations a major life event; they were about four years apart.

All of these problems seem to worsen when my sleep is bad, and my sleep is always bad. I have utterly given up on being a well rested person and am a hostage to the vicious whims of my body clock. Now that I am not forced to wake up early, it's gotten even worse. I can't bring myself to even start projects that I'd been telling myself I was only putting off for school. I am hanging out with friends, but still constantly wonder why I am not doing more with my time, or at the very least actually enjoying myself in my leisure. School and work were hell, but free time is suffocating. I don't really understand why my life has come to be this way, but this seems to be the way that it is.

I'm worried that I might be about to enter (or maybe already in the midst of) a shame induced downward spiral. I'm not normally the type to do hard drugs, but in the last two and a half weeks I've dropped acid five times. This doesn't seem to be part of the problem however; I'm weirdly unaffected by these trips and am not having negative experiences from them (although I think I'm done for now). Simultaneously, my family is falling apart and my parents are talking about divorce over my sister's out of control decisions. Among my family and friends (most of whom also struggle with mild to serious mental instability), I am usually considered the one who ""has it together."" This is part of the reason that I have never sought professional help, along with a strong, quiet kind of discouragement of that sort of thing from my family and society as a whole.

From the day I finished my last exam I've felt this indescribable, seeping apathy. I don't know how it's possible to feel apathetic and panicked at the same time, but I seem to have pulled it off. Maybe it's more like paralysis. In any case, I can't seem to do anything constructive, I haven't been exercising, I haven't been looking for work (I applied for hundreds of jobs over the last semester), I have neither done anything stressful nor for even one minute felt relaxed. I'm always surprised when I am hungry, but if I really scrutinize my day will often find that I haven't eaten for 18+ hours. The worst thing is the underlying truth that nothing has changed and I was always like this. I can't believe I graduated at all.

I have enough money to last three months in my current living situation. In two weeks, I'm going to start applying to food service jobs. Although I have a BS in computer science, I feel that at this time in my life I am not cut out for a real job or really capable of contributing to anything, but I'm such a leech that I'll continue pursuing a career-type job while working in food service anyway.

**TLDR**

I guess I'll wrap up by saying what I meant to say in the first place: I'm worried about my life. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed something, and I am incapable of pursuing things that will make my life better. I'm afraid that my poor self esteem and self hatred will lead me to start making actively self-destructive decisions, and I don't really know where that path will end because I can't tell the difference between misery and happiness anymore. I don't know what to do about any of these things and honestly I can't see how posting this will help either, but I feel like I need to do something and I guess this is something.",3,"  3 major medical catastropes, mental health, stalked, abused, ADHD "

"I was scared and haven't told anybody but I did it. 50 mg of Sertaline down, lets see how I do before I take my next dose.

Day 2 Update: Wow, what an overwhelming amount of support and advice, thank you! I have just taken my second dose and bar a slightly upset stomach and dry mouth I haven't really noticed any of the side effects I was so afraid of. I feel so relieved to finally accept my depression as a physical illness.

Day 3 Update: My insomnia has gotten a bit worse but my mind feels kind of clear and alert (the alert bit is what's keeping me up). Happy so far and will keep going. 3rd dose taken.

Day 4 Update: Yesterday felt like my ""brain fog"" lifted so I tried to catch up at work. It resulted in a terrible night where everything made me anxious (more like paranoid) and with a clear mind I could comprehend it all more making me very down. Today I feel nauseous with no drive to do anything. I'm now wondering if the brain fog was some sort of coping mechanism. Other than that this has been my ""normal"" for a while so dose 4 is down.

Day 5: Down, anxious and not in the mood to do anything. Dose 5 taken.

Day 9: Not sure if anybody is still reading this but for time in a while I didn't feel sad yesterday. It was like it was still there but dampened down. I hope it stays, it's such a relief. Otherwise my insomnia is worse and I found I cared little about doing anything the last couple of days.

Day 14 - Final Update: These are definitely taking the edge off. I was thinking yesterday how badly I didn't want to go back to how I felt 2 weeks ago, that's a huge amount of progress. I've also realised there is no way these will work without therapy, so I've rebooked my cancelled appointments. Overall the tummy upset/nausea is gone, I feel more mentally alert, find it harder to sleep and have less physical energy. I also have moments where I don't care what I do then later care a lot.

Gave up pot (only 2 days) 
Going to AA daily.
Going to therapy weekly. 
Taking meds.
Sleeping every night.
eating better (like every day) 
Went low-contact with narcissistic mother (moved out of her house)

Still very low energy.
not working out.
not cooking, not eating that well, but better.
not drinking water.
hopeless.

My psychiatrist seems happy that I am doing so much better than I was, but really, is this as good as it gets? I am glad I have removed the toxic people (mother, bf) and a bad job, from my life. But I haven't refilled it with new people. I am meeting new people at AA. I am uncovering a lot of abuse I suffered, but was unaware of. Turning up a lot of sadness. It's hard connecting with others.

"**CLIFFS--** Was high on life, having good party times. Let it all get to my head, inflated my ego and created an image I wasn't able to maintain. Was pretending to be someone I wasn't. Had a nervous breakdown, sobering event, and lost all my confidence and now am filled with self loathing as if my life has peaked. Doctors diagnosed me with bipolar manic depression 8ish years ago. I tried some medication but didn't like it. Smoked weed to push my problems aside for many years and now they are coming back almost as strong as ever. I don't know how to get comfortable around my peers anymore. I feel like my facial expressions and personality are completely empty and Im having trouble finding myself. All this is making it really tough for me to open up in relationships, especially ones with females my age. Im 28 and its been 8 years since I've been in an intimate situation with a woman.

The worst part is, I remember how things used to be. How confident and comfortable I was in my own skin. The attraction from girls I liked. I liked who I was. Now, all I can see is some sad lonely man whos trapped inside his own mind and overly self conscious. I cant stop beating myself up about it.

I am a master student (yea fuck me right?) I am studying a master in economics with an scolarship I won to Europe (lol right) I do not even know how I got this scolarship, my grades were not that good at the university where I struggled all the time for being the best, but never was. I worked for 2 and half years in a bank, I never EVER knew what to do, what what my work assingment was, and whenever I asked my supervisor for directions I ended up more confused and never dared to ask again the SAME GODAMN question because it is annoying I feell into this trap all the time. It was deppressing, my supervisor used to call me worried about my situation I was all the time the last one delivering work assingments, was changed of department becauase of my low productivity. etc

After that nightmare ended, I came here to Europe to study, a new begining, no it was not like that, I still have the same problems, and discovered MANY MORE, i am not organized, (nor do I know how to be organized) I do not know how to manage my time, I do not understand the more practical assignments such as econometrics, I do not know how to write a fucking paper, everybody does, everybody understands, I am socially arkward, I dissapear into the people talking, I am not handsome, I hate my body.

I want to end my life, I reallly want to end it all right here, but if it were not because of my parents, my 2 friends and my SO i would not be here. I am affraid of cause pain to them. But I cannot stand it, I hate being the shitty stupid good for nothing kid, during this master I have left classes, got bad grades, and as usual, the last in the class in terms of perfomance or reliability.

why? Why does it happen to me? I really struggle to be better at what I do (I must admit I do not like my career) but no results? I really struggle to understand concepts, theory, processes, but no avail. I do not get better, and it hurts, it hurts to try it one more time, I am affraid to be dissapointed of myself again, I am affraid of feeling that sensation of not being to do something.

"I was diagnosed with mild depression which then got worse and I've been on sertraline since August 02 of 2016 (50mg) and recently switched up to 100mg. I really thought this would help with my depression, but so far I feel like shit. I've been depressed since March of 2014, I'm not sure what triggered it but it slowly crept up in a few months into 2014. On March 19th, my computer was caught by malicious software and I don't know why but it sent me over the edge - I couldn't function, I stared into space and I felt so dead inside. I spent months meticulously removing myself from everything from the internet, keeping core programs and user accounts fro some things, but over those years I cried and my family got sick of me quickly. For context, before my trigger, I had friends that I had met online and became good friends with. We spent days chatting and telling jokes, and I didn't care what anyone else thought of me. I was quick to retort if someone angered me...but now I just feel so empty inside. And I just left them. I removed all trace of myself from our chats, I upset them and I upset myself. I spent months processing what was happening to me. 

In fact, I spent my birthday removing my old skype account and removing people from it. Since then, I've over compensated for what my brain considered 'a failure in social ability' and now I try so damn hard to try and fit in. My anxiety sky rocketed - if I think something rude or harmful about someone? I have to literally walk backwards and tell myself that this wasn't going to happen and that I needed to shut the fuck up. And then I kept walking on.


I used to love videogames too. I recently purchased Battlefield 1 (50% off, hoo boy) and I was always fascinated by war, and they dids a good job. But I'm always examining things..for example, I feel like very business is out to get your money (which in fairness, they are) but I feel like it is malicious attempt to undermine me.
I always look at things and people and go 'Oh! I wonder what their next attempt to screw me over will be?'
I have one friend at the moment. All my other friends bailed on me as soon as we went our separate educational ways - I went to college, they didn't. And they talked about me behind my back, even those who did attend college with me did this, and I was so fed up with these to faced spiteful shitlords that I called friends.
But now nothing makes me happy - I shrugged at Overwatch (its cool, and something I try to play, but I just feel like I'm not good enough, and that this games is meaningless in real life.) And I just can't play games. I haven't got the attention for it - I can spend 20 minutes watching a youtube video before I have to move on. I have the Skyrim Special Edition on PC, and I really want to play it, but I feel so alone when I do try. I can't immerse myself, I feel way to aware of the real world, and that I should be doing something productive with myself rather than waste my time on a 'videogame', but then I hate everything outside. I hate businessmen, I hate self entitled people, I hate false people, and I don't know what to do!


I like buying stuff. And this is nearly self destructive as I find myself broke all the time, and I buy stuff I don't necessarily need, but randomly crave. I really want to save for a movie authentic Stormtrooper helmet from EFX though. (They are very cool.)

Sometimes I think to myself 'ignorance is bliss' and I want to be someone who doesn't have to be so aware, and I know it sounds super snotty, but I feel like sometimes I'm too smart to be happy; I'm shitty at Mathematics, but I did well in English literature and I like to tinker with electronics. But sometimes I think about things that I don't believe most people my age (16 by the way) will do anytime soon - I like thinking about philosophers and I've been meaning to reads Sun Zhu's 'Art of War' but I know I won't actually do it.
Sometimes I feel like the things I do (act smart, own a bible because it looks cool, act grumpy and mysterious) is because I want to impress. I want people to feel sympathy for me because I'm a 'broken figure' with a 'dark past' and a hidden vulnerability that I am all to careless to talk about.


I've never had a girlfriend. I've been close and I've been close to people, but I don't think I could stick it out - opening myself up to another person, show how weak and vile I really am. This affects me in my daily life too - I have a thing for Daisy Ridley (as do 99.9998% of men on planet earth) and I'm sat there like 'man, how cool would it be if me and Daisy were a thing! Y'know, long walks on the beach!) and stuff like that. I know its a tad creepy but I'm 16 and my hormones are wack out of shape.


I've had suicidual thoughts, but not really enough to make me want to go further. I overdosed on sertraline once, (however, I wouldn't call 200mg of meds as opposed to one 50mg anm 'overdose'.) But everyone was so angry at me.
I was once kicked out of my house in May (29th) 2016. I took a sleeping bag and a warm jumper and ran to the church near my house, and I stood on a wall and watched people walk by. I phoned a friend (who recently bailed on me) and he invited me to stay for the night. (No one has ever done this for me, and maybe never will again, and I tried so hard to make this friendship work but ultimately failed.)
I also argue with my family so much that sometimes I feel like a sociopath has taken over my body - a snarling beast of a man whose intent is to exert power and rule this small house. And I snarl and laugh at the people I live with. And I don't hate it. I feel justified sometimes, and I've been called a 'sociopath and psychopath + countless more by own mother.. But I don't blame her, we are very alike and I would do the same. My siblings have told me to kill myself multiple times between them and called me a 'monster'.


For exercise context, everyone says 'aww yeah, do some exercise, you'll feel better.' (Yes I know about endorphins) and for more context, I am a certified 1st degree Black Belt Taekwondo Martial Artist from April of 2015. (Nearly 2 years now, jeez...) I used to love running, but now I'm a little more porky.
My dad has never lived with us. He left just after I was born, but I see him sometimes. He bought me my first motorbike in 2016. It was consequently stolen. And I wasn't angry. I felt nothing.
In my family, my great uncle (lets call him Uncle Bob) killed himself. it's not something I should talk about, but when its something I consider on the daily, I don't think an old memory is a large price to pay (yes I'm an asshat.) I know this is pretentious of me, but I've felt like jumping out of my window so many times. Thats it. Done. Game over.

I also have a problem with meaning, or should I say I have a problem with believing in one - I'm a self called nihilist, and can't help but believe the world was created as a freak accident, and we are just a byproduct, that there is no God, that we all die and are forgotten. It is pretty cliche, but I identify quite easily with Rick from Rick and Morty and Greg House from House M.D. (Everyone says they do too, I know.) Also, I really want a cane. For walking. At 16. My mum says it would be embarrassing, but my legs are usually terrible and a cane wouldn't be merely cosmetic for me, I think it would help (Should I get one? :/)
I just feel like shit all the time. And suicide wouldn't be difficult for me to do, it's just I don't really want to. I'm in limbo.

I feel really comfy with her as a person and we've started to build a good rapport, but I've been struggling with intense anxiety since I was a child and depression for over a decade.

"Hey guys, first time playing here, just wanted to get some opinions. I've been on a variety of antidepressants over the years, and it seems that when my medication is not fully working I get this unwell feeling in my stomach. I'm not sad or unhappy, and it isn't emotionally triggered, there is just this awful feeling my stomach. It's not an upset stomach, it just feels unwell, and it changes my mood because it's all I can focus on.

 I was on Brintellix for a year and was a miracle drug for me after a year of finding a medication that worked. Symptoms then began about 3 months ago in the form of this unwell feeling in my stomach. We increased the dosage and symptoms went way with the change, and that lasted about 3 months until now. I'm now on Effexor wth mixed results after a month and a half. I take 75MG in the morning but the symptoms arise around the early afternoon.

"Where do I start? I guess the background: I am in nursing school, and this past semester broke me, I developed anxiety, and my depression returned. I have been since medicated with prozac, and it helps. I don't feel nearly as hopeless, I don't feel worthless, I feel like me, before all this stress.

Well last night, about 11pm, I had an intrusive thought, that I should just die, and I should just get it over with. Now to be fair, I had a plan IF I failed second semester, which I did not do. I even just came home from the area I would do it in. I commonly have thoughts that wonder what my eulogy would be, but honestly I attributed that to my natural curiosity. 

This thought, it felt different, it felt real, and it scared me. I felt odd, my BP shot up, my pulse plunged, I felt short of breath but my o2 saturation was normal. I monitored it every 15 min, for an hour, and when it wasn't changing I took myself to the hospital. It was there that I realized what had just happened. 

You see, I am a migraine sufferer with a rare condition, my migraines are rarely painful, most just a headache, but the auras, they fucking SUCK. My first one ever mirrored a stroke, my second one I went partly blind for an hour, with all of them I had a change in how I talk. 

When I opened my mouth to talk, for the first time since feeling this way, I realized it was a migraine, but I was scared. I had a thought that I have had once before in my life, and it was terrifying to me. My voice sounded robotic, like something you would expect someone having severe asthma would talk like. My tremors were exacerbated where it was difficult to sign my name. They take me back, and all my symptoms are still there, and I am put on suicide watch while they page the psychologist. Here I am, 30 years old, some people consider me the most stable person they know, when I told them that I started antidepressants the general comments were along the lines of: no surprised you would be willing to reach out for help.  

So I sit like the fraud I am. Wanting to make sure I am medically OK, and mentally OK. I knew as soon as I had the invasive thought that I would not act on it, but it felt so real, and scary. Well turns out auras from migraines in depressed people can cause these thoughts. Fuck. Me. 

So about 4am they discharge me when I tell them that I am not going to act on my impulse, and that I don't have a plan, and I will see outpatient. I feel like a sham, I am embarrassed, It felt like that wasn't me there.

The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. 

So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications?

The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"I need some advice on coping techniques or strategies to avoid crying. It happens too often in the middle of conversations or when people are even a LITTLE mean (sometimes even jokingly so).


&amp;nbsp;


-Meds are not an option- I have been on them and they have negatively affected my health so had to quit (blood pressure and weight on various types).

-I have anxiety with depressive episodes (but no mania). Not bi-polar, no clear ""type"". Probably would need a second opinion, which I can't afford right now (and not sure it'd be helpful- psychiatrists spend so much less time with patients than therapists- whom I prefer), and haven't found a free therapist/sliding scale one that I like. Only one I really trusted/got along with is way out of budget.

-I cry at the drop of a hat. Certain things people say can trigger me (even if I know they had no idea it was a sensitive topic). Sometimes I emotionally and physically feel nothing about a topic and think I've gotten past it, and feel no physical reaction or feelings when it's brought up, but can still end up in tears. People's tones of voice can make me cry, even if I'm in the superior position (I.e. a high student today who I know has emotional issues and trouble at home yelled at me...It wasn't personal, he's just an asshole or takes out his issues on others...But I almost ended up crying as soon as the students left the room. I laughed to keep from crying in that instance but it upset the student and obviously was not the best coping mechanism- I did not consciously choose to do this by the way. I should have yelled back, but trouble is, when I feel angry/anger...I fucking cry).

-I know this is a dopamine or seratonin issue in part because the SSRI I was on cut my crying to 1/5 of how often I cry right now (off meds almost 6 months now), and I only cried when I actually felt sad (I.e. a super sad movie, a relative in the hospital, I really hurt myself by stubbing my toe really hard).


&amp;nbsp;


Please provide any resources that you can if possible. Or advice on meditative practices, or ways to trick my brain off of focusing on something that may trigger tears. I can't afford this affecting my professional life, as it's already affected my personal life (I hardly have made any new friends in the past year, all of my friends are from before I left school, and they were understanding because grad school is super stressful...But it's not normal to be like this now).

My sister is bipolar, OCD, struggles with manic depression as does my mom. My brother unfortunately lost his fight with depression a few years ago. Actually, this month will make 7 years. I have always dealt with my anxiety quietly, kept it to myself. Through the years things have gotten...darker. I am in a happy relationship with my fiance, I have a decent job, a dog I love and a wonderful family but I've always felt pretty disconnected. Content...never happy...always foggy...incapable of feeling anything but sadness I suppose, I just thought I was super empathetic lol I have never found enough ""joy"" in anything to have any hobbies, which has always bothered me. Well. Here we are...about 5 years of straight downhill later and two days ago I started to have some kind of breakdown of the century that really came to a head last night and at work this morning. I am scrambling to hold on to any sliver lining I can find. I am exhausted. I have cried for 2 days straight, had the most obsessive...intrusive thoughts that i cant seem to shake. I am absolutely sick to my stomach and can not hold anything down. I feel like the part of me that has been fighting has literally given up and is begging for help, this current person is scary as hell. My boss made me call every doctor that took my insurance to get an appointment  asap after my...""episode"". I have an appointment for in the morning. I am terrified. The thought of medication really fucks with my anxiety. I get paranoid a doctor is just going to prescribe me stuff (like they did my brother) to get rid of me with out really LISTENING to me. But I am going to cross my fingers and hope for whatever ""best"" I can find. There has to be more to this life than what I am currently living. I can not feel like this for forever, I won't. I have no idea how I am going to make it through the night, but I am going to figure it out. Do any of you have any suggestions of things I should bring up with the doctor to make the most of my first appointment?

"Haven't had a job since getting out of the military ~1 yr ago. I've purged most things from my life and am finally selling my house this month. All in all I'll have no debt, car+dog, ~$40k, and ""full"" medical + $1300/month in va benefits.

"Hey everybody, I ran out of my Lexapro/Cipralex meds about a week ago, having an emergency appointment with the doc tomorrow. Since I ran out, I've been having these weird pulses in my head, lots of cranial pressure and ringing in the ears for a couple seconds, and then it subsides. Sometimes it coincides with movement (like getting up from a chair, but also like going up in an elevator). Does anyone have any experience going cold turkey from escitalopram? Is this a known symptom of sudden stoppage? Thanks.",3,"Lexapro/ Cipralex a week ago, have an emergency meeting tomorrow"
"This is a rant/vent so thanks in advance to anyone who actually reads any of this.

I'd say my depression has slowly been growing since I was 12 and first googled reasons to live. 26 now and I try to live away from my family in other states or countries, though I always end up being financially dependent on my parents and returning back for Christmas time.

This year was particularly shit, I failed my uni course and turned smoking weed 24/7. I was only really sober for the first 5mins of each day before I'd start pounding cones. So my parents bought me a one way cross state ticket home. My parents are great caring people, which makes me feel terrible for not liking them (not that I'd ever tell them that).

Everytime I come back here my suicidal ideations get stronger and stronger. I've started seeing a psychologist here once a week,  paid for by my parents, and tried going up to 30mg of lexapro a day which along with weed withdrawal, if that even is a thing,  caused me to freak out and spend the day on suicide watch in hospital. So back to my regular 20mg. My parents want to keep me here, I guess they think they can help me, but I hate this house and all the old memories, accumulated junk and thoughts it gives me.  And I hate myself for hating the privileged middle class upbringing I have had.

After failing and withdrawing from university my student government support was cut and I had drained all my money on weed.

So now I feel stuck here where it all began, with no financial means to leave and no one to blame but myself. I keep telling myself I should choose life, but the other side of me seems I have had enough experiences of this world and suicide looks like such a beautiful, peaceful and final release into nothingness.

Thanks for being here r/depression, I find solace in reading your experiences and knowing that other people out there have their own similar battles. I've been getting battered with positivity from my family telling me to ""get outside and have a nice day in the sun"" or ""pull myself up by my bootstraps and get on with it"" or ""if you get a job you won't have time to think about it""
Once again I understand that this is them only caring and trying to help and once again I hate myself for hating their help.

"My psychologist gave me a new med to try and it was amazing. I felt 90% percent back to my happy self when on just my other meds I'm about 50%. Colors seemed to be brighter and I found myself feeling happy most days. Best 6 weeks ever. 

When she gave it to me she told me to stop taking it if the new med messes with my stomach too much.

Well it did, to the point where any pressure on my stomach caused me pain and I would have to just lay down until the upset stomach subsided. I toughed it out for awhile because i felt so good but it just got to be too much so I stopped taking it about a week ago when it started making me vomit.

I only have until next Monday until I see her again but everything is just awful. I feel like I'm worse off then before I took it and I don't know how I'm going to make it. Time is just dragging and every day is just awful. I find myself snapping at people and I just wanna cry all the time. It feels like when I wasn't taking anything.

"Sorry for the wall of text i really need to vent and get some help or advice.


I grew up well normally i guess but as i git older and into middle school i started noticing wierd things like when i would argue with my brother he would call me retarded and small little things like people looking at me wierd,etc.


when i went to alternative school for getting into trouble i was in a whole other section with other slightly off kids(there was a other section for people with much worse and noticeable illnesses? I guess)


And now im a freshman more and more little things now that 2nd semester started i got put into special weight lifting (yes its for special people) but everyone in there looks normal like me and i have a freind in there aswell from that alternative school.


My mental state is a piece of shit to say the least i cant concentrate for more than a minute i cant hold any conversations partly cause im socially awkward and have anxiety this has made me deppresed and suicidal while a completely shut down from the world.

I do smoke weed twice every month or so and have tooken others to cope, i drink alot and heavily when i do, and smoke tobacco on the regular. Do these contribute ot relate in any way to my mental state?

I need some help guys i hope this doesnt get buried imam afraid i might do something bad to myself or others as i go from deppressed to happy often but ive been mostly deporesed and down.

"So I feel like it's sorta stupid to be making a Reddit about what I feel but to be honest no one else really listens to me it feels like, so without further delay here's my bullshit day in a nutshell. So before I give you a rundown on my shitty days I should let you know that I am in high school and have Touretts, not where I curse or anything like that but where I make weird movements, over my life I have been able to control these in most situations in front of people but lately it's been much harder. Every day I wake up and feel a lomming ball of sadness and stress as I get dressed and go to the buss. Sometimes I try to talk to some people but I find it hard because it's almost as if they only want to really talk on Snapchat and not in person. Most days I just pretend to be happy and try to remember all the random bullshit we need to learn in school (even though I don't understand why it's taught I still remember it). I used to get straight As in middle school but lately I've been getting Cs Bs and As (which I'm fine with for some reason). Anyway my parents usually scream at me about my grades even if there not that bad. they ended up sending me to a therapist because they said I was acting different And wasn't making enough friends. For some reason I kept lieing to the theripist  because I found it hard to describe my sadness in words. He ended up telling me that he was only a adult therapist and blew me off. I felt like I should have told him the truth but to be honest if he couldn't see that I wasn't telling it he was a shitty therapist. Ever scince then I've been going down a dark void that I can't escape (metaphorically of course) I still wake up every day depressed and my Tourette's is out of control even in happy moments I am sad and feel like I can't find happiness no matter what happens. I don't want to kill my self btw but I'm not afraid of dieing if you know what I mean. I also found this hard to right because there's so many more details I left out and sill couldn't describe my sadness I hope I did good enough to get you a idea of what I'm going through.

"This is the most incredibly frustrating and scary time of my life. I have no clue what to think. I'm about to start my second semester at college. I barely made it through the first one. I had been on Zoloft 50mg and even got down to 25 mg for anxiety and depression. But during the later months of the semester of college. I got hit like a truck. I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist  at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change. It's like this huge jumbled mess of what I call brain fog, anxiety, existential worry ( I just took two philosophy courses and have always been worried about life and death and religion), and depression. I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future.

"So basically since last night I have been on the panic attack rollercoaster. Crying, freaking out, insomnia, and the feeling of staring into a black hole of hopeless nothingness.

Well I did my self-care and took an emergency xanax, I've been drinking chamomile and letting the crying come when it comes. I've talked to family and they know what's going on but like...

When I'm not actually crying I don't feel a god damn thing.
I feel dead and hopeless. Nothing feels good. I look at the future and think, what's the point?

I've been trying to do cheerup things, self-care things, and all they do is make me cry in frustration.

"My so-called 'passion' for music has driving me to near self mutilation. I'm starting to think that the 'passion' has worn off and gotten deep. I've been dealing with some deep seeded issues involving music, my self image and creative-side. The last few months of 2016, I've nearly stopped most recording and writing cause the anxiety of trying to present it online or in person overwhelms me. 

Looking towards the new year, I've decided to do things I wouldn't normally do, an open mic last night with a friend and I felt so out of place. And tonight I tried to record a vocal at home and just couldn't get my head into it. I almost sent my microphone through my computer screen. And the kicker, I had a conversation with an industry friend and he is like 'follow your passion', keep writing and recording and I keep texting. 

I doesn't make me feel good, why should I follow it if it makes me crazy. I have a great job and it's given me time to think on life and money and where I wanna end up and I feel that at 26 I've been force-fed this crap about following your passion and it will lead to happiness when all it's led to social anxiety, perfectionism, lack of trust, depression and envy. Why can't everyone just let everyone figure out everything in their own time, why is it the modern way to make everyone rush and feel guilty that we have nothing or not doing enough.

I'm mentally exhausted from trying to figure out the whole thing and I don't think it's worth it anymore. The best part is that I keep asking for help and nobody seems to have any ideas or wants to help. Maybe I'm naive about that.
